Entries follow the [GNU Change Log style](https://www.gnu.org/prep/standards/html_node/Style-of-Change-Logs.html): a short topic line, an optional body describing the change, then a list of affected files with the names of classes / methods / variables in parentheses so each symbol is greppable.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- **Watch button (JacRed + TorrServer)**

  - Movies, TV shows, animation and anime get a play button in the card's app
    bar on the Windows build.
  - It searches a self-hosted JacRed by title, original title and year, hands
    the chosen magnet to TorrServer and plays the stream in a built-in libmpv
    player with audio and subtitle selection.
  - Settings, Integrations, Watch holds both addresses (defaults are the local
    Docker ports) and a check for the two servers.
  - The stream opens in the user's VLC by default (vlc.exe on Windows, an
    intent on Android); the built-in player is the fallback and a setting.
  - The picker also takes your own torrent: paste a magnet link into the
    search field or use the add button for a magnet from the clipboard or a
    .torrent file.
  - A labeled Catalog button in the top bar opens shelves: recommendations
    from your own taste, trending movies and series, top series, cartoons, old
    and Soviet cartoons, anime and old anime from TMDB, plus IMDb Top 250 and
    Kinopoisk lists read from a small container that refreshes them every two
    days. A tap on a title goes to the torrent picker.

## [0.44.0] - 2026-09-16

### Added

- **Search the library by details**

  - The search field on Home and Collections gets a mode menu in front of it:
    "By title" or "By details".
  - Details mode matches genres, tags, studios, authors, publishers, subjects,
    developers, artists, label, platform, format, season and release year of
    every media type.
  - A comma joins conditions with AND, a slash (or `|`) inside a condition
    gives OR: `horror / thriller, 2019`. The matcher takes a phrase whole, so
    `kyoto animation` is one value.
  - Genres, anime and manga tags, manga authors, an album label and a custom
    item's platform are tappable chips on the item card. A tap closes the
    card and runs that value as a details search on the screen underneath;
    with a details query already showing, the tap adds the value as one more
    AND condition. From Search and Releases the tap lands on Home.

- **Showcase section in the personalization hub**

  - A fourth card on the hub landing opens a page of release boards in two
    blocks. "Out now": anime this season, anime next season, in theaters now,
    coming to theaters, new episodes this week, upcoming game releases, new
    albums. "Popular": trending movies, trending TV shows, popular anime.
  - A card carries the cover, the countdown to the next episode, premiere or
    release ("S4E8 · in 5d", "Premiere · Today", "Release · Out now"), the
    weekday and date, format, episode count, runtime, studio or artist,
    genres and a description. Over a day out the countdown shows days and
    hours, under it hours and minutes. It ticks once a minute.
  - Boards sort by the nearest date; entries without one go last. A dated
    board switches between a plain list and buckets by weekday, by date or by
    week: anime this season and new episodes this week open by weekday, anime
    next season by week. A board longer than six cards collapses behind
    "Show all".
  - Blocks order their boards by how many items of that media type the
    library holds.
  - One board's error or empty answer leaves the others alone. Each keeps its
    own retry button, and on an AniList rate limit it counts down the wait.
  - A sheet in the title bar lists every board with a checkbox, plus a switch
    for titles already in a collection: badge or hide. The choices are kept
    per profile; a board switched off in Discover stays off.

- **Likes, notes and replays page**

  - The personalization hub gets a third section: every liked or noted
    episode, season, chapter, volume, page, part or track in the library,
    grouped by title, freshest title first.
  - Titles with a replay count above zero join the list too, under their own
    "Replays" heading ahead of the marked titles. A replayed title that also
    carries marks shows the replay row first, then its units.
  - Each unit shows its number and the cached episode or track name, a heart
    when liked, and the note text cut at two lines.
  - One row of icon toggles: a heart, a note and a replay arrow pick any
    combination of likes, notes and replays, and a chip per media type narrows
    further. The top-bar search field matches note text, unit names and the
    title the same way Home does; a replay row is reached through its title.
  - Tapping a title or a unit opens the item card. A mark set or removed in a
    card shows up on the page at once.
  - The hub card previews the mark and replay count and the two freshest
    entries.

  * packages/core/lib/database/dao/item_mark_dao.dart (ItemMarkDao.getAllMarks):
    New; joins tv_episodes_cache and audio_tracks_cache for the unit name.

    likesEmptyBody, likesNoMatches, likesTrackWithDisc, likesMarkCount,
    likesSectionRewatch, likesSectionMarks, likesRewatchFilter,
    likesRewatchTimes): New strings.

- **Set the start and completion date in one tap**

  The date dialog behind the Started and Completed tiles on the item card
  gets a "Started and finished this day" action. It writes the picked day
  into both fields, and the title moves to Completed unless it is there
  already.

  * lib/shared/widgets/dual_date_picker_dialog.dart (DualDateResult.pickedBoth,
    DualDateResult.appliesToBoth, showDualDatePickerResult.allowBoth,
    DualDatePickerDialog.allowBoth): New; the action row wraps on a phone,
    and the dialog height follows the space left by the keyboard.
  * lib/shared/widgets/media_detail_view.dart (ActivityDateField.both,
    _MediaDetailViewState._pickActivityDate): Offer the action from both
    tiles and report the new field.
  * lib/features/collections/screens/item_detail_screen.dart
    (_ItemDetailScreenState._updateActivityDate): Write both dates for the
    new field in one update.
  * lib/l10n/app_*.arb (dualDatePickerBothDates): New string.

### Changed

- **Search shows no feeds on an empty query**

  showcase.

    (_SearchScreenState._buildContent): One empty state for every media type.

    lib/features/showcase/widgets/showcase_settings_sheet.dart.
  * lib/features/search/models/search_source.dart (SearchSource): Drop
    buildDiscoverFeed, along with its twenty-one implementations under
    lib/features/search/sources/.

- **Personalization hub opens on a landing page of section cards**

  - Statistics, Recommendations, Showcase and Likes are cards with a live
    preview: the headline numbers, a strip of recommended posters, what is
    out now, the latest marks. A tap opens the section full screen with a
    back arrow.
  - The genre cloud is an icon in the statistics header, next to Share.
  - Pressing the centre button while a section is open returns to the landing
    page; Android back and gamepad B pop the section before closing the hub.

  * lib/features/personalization/screens/personalization_screen.dart
    (PersonalizationScreen): Hosts the hub's own Navigator.
  * lib/features/personalization/screens/personalization_hub_screen.dart
    (PersonalizationHubScreen),
    lib/features/personalization/widgets/hub_section_card.dart (HubSectionCard),
    lib/features/personalization/widgets/hub_stats_preview.dart (HubStatsPreview),
    lib/features/personalization/widgets/hub_recommendations_preview.dart
    (HubRecommendationsPreview),
    lib/features/personalization/widgets/personalization_sub_screen.dart
    (PersonalizationSubScreen, pushPersonalizationSection): New.
  * lib/features/statistics/screens/statistics_screen.dart
    (_StatisticsScreenState._openGenreCloud): Genre cloud button in the header.
  * lib/features/recommendations/utils/recommendation_cover.dart
    (recommendationCoverCache): New;
    lib/features/recommendations/widgets/recommendation_row.dart
    (_RecommendationRowWidgetState.build) uses it.
  * lib/shared/navigation/app_shell.dart (_AppShellState._openPreferenceCloud,
    _AppShellState._handleBack): Pop the hub's navigator first.
  * lib/features/welcome/widgets/menu_tour_items.dart,
    lib/shared/navigation/app_bottom_bar.dart,
    lib/shared/navigation/app_sidebar.dart: Centre button labelled
    "Personalization".
  * lib/l10n/app_*.arb (personalizationTitle, personalizationStatsHint,
    personalizationRecommendationsHint): New; genreCloudTitle now reads
    "Genre cloud"; personalizationTabCloud removed.

### Fixed

- **Search inside a collection matches album artists and book authors**

  The collection screen and the All items screen run the same title search:
  name, tag names, comments, and the artist of an album or the author of a
  book.

  * packages/core/lib/utils/item_search.dart (ItemSearch, ItemSearch.matches,
    ItemSearch.creatorsOf): New; one matcher for both search modes.
  * lib/features/collections/helpers/collection_filters.dart
    (CollectionFilters.apply): Delegates the search step to ItemSearch.
  * lib/features/home/screens/all_items_screen.dart (_AllItemsScreenState.build,
    _AllItemsScreenState._applyFilter, _AllItemsScreenState._countByMediaType,
    _AllItemsScreenState._matchesNonTypeFilters): Match through
    itemSearchProvider; _matchesTagName and _matchesCreator removed.

- **Adding a title no longer flashes the library through its loader**

  Home, the showcase boards and the hub previews keep what they show while
  the list reloads; the new title and its badge appear in place.

  * lib/features/home/providers/all_items_provider.dart (AllItemsNotifier.build,
    AllItemsNotifier.refresh, AllItemsNotifier._loading): Keep the previous
    list under a reload.

- **The window survives a landscape phone with the keyboard up**

  The top-bar search field, or a filter sheet with a text field such as the
  AniList tag or studio picker, used to leave the sidebar and the screen
  behind it a few dozen pixels tall and overflowing. They now scroll within
  that space.

  * lib/shared/widgets/min_height_body.dart (MinHeightBody, kMinBodyHeight):
    New.
  * lib/shared/navigation/app_shell.dart (_AppShellState._buildScaffold):
    Sidebar row wrapped in MinHeightBody.
  * lib/features/search/screens/search_screen.dart (_SearchScreenState.build),
    lib/features/home/screens/all_items_screen.dart
    (_AllItemsScreenState.build): Body wrapped in MinHeightBody.

- **AniList tag picker survives a small sheet**

  With the on-screen keyboard up, the picker's title, search field and
  toggles scroll together with the tag list; the action row stays put.

  * lib/features/search/widgets/anilist_tag_picker.dart
    (_AniListTagPickerState.build, _AniListTagPickerState._buildHeader,
    _AniListTagPickerState._buildList): Header and list moved into one
    CustomScrollView; the list is a SliverList.

- **Shimmer placeholders keep quiet when a screen goes away**

  Leaving a screen while its skeletons are on it logs nothing.

  * lib/shared/widgets/shimmer_loading.dart (_ShimmerTimeline.release): Reset
    the shared phase after the frame.

- **Linux window keeps the GTK header bar to GNOME**

  Outside GNOME the window uses the desktop's own title bar, on Wayland as
  well as on X11.

  * linux/runner/my_application.cc (desktop_wants_header_bar): New; reads
    XDG_CURRENT_DESKTOP first, then the X11 window manager name.

- **IGDB search finds titles made of common words**

  - A game such as "Until Then" shows up in the results.
  - An empty first page is retried as a name filter, keeping the platform,
    genre, mode, rating and year filters.

  * lib/core/api/igdb/igdb_games_api.dart (IgdbGamesApi.searchGames,
    IgdbGamesApi._postGames): Name-filter retry on an empty first page; the
    shared request and parse helper also serves getGamesByIds,
    getTopGamesByPlatform and browseGames.

## [0.43.0] - 2026-08-20

### Added

- **"Ignored" item status**

  A seventh status for titles kept in the library but deliberately parked.
  It behaves like any other status: pick it on the item card, in the table
  cell or from the bulk menu, filter by it, and see it in the collection
  statistics. An external tracker never moves an item out of it.

  * packages/core/lib/models/item_status.dart (ItemStatus.ignored): New value,
    stored as `ignored`, sorted last.
  * packages/core/lib/models/item_status_logic.dart (computeDatesForStatus,
    _externalStatusPriority): Keep both dates untouched; rank above `dropped`
    so only an authoritative downgrade (RetroAchievements) may override it.
  * packages/core/lib/database/dao/collection_dao.dart
    (CollectionDao.getCollectionItemStats): Count the new status.
  * lib/data/repositories/collection_repository.dart (CollectionStats.ignored): New field.
  * lib/shared/constants/item_status_ui.dart (ItemStatusUi.color,
    ItemStatusUi.materialIcon, ItemStatusUi.localizedLabel, ItemStatusUi.genericLabel):
    Muted color and a block icon.
  * lib/shared/theme/app_palette.dart (AppPalette.statusIgnored),
    lib/shared/theme/app_colors.dart (AppColors.statusIgnored): New derived token.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/rich/rich_hero_styles.dart
    (_statusDisplayOrder): Show it last in the rich-banner breakdown.
  * lib/l10n/app_*.arb: statusIgnored in all locales.

- **Selectable banner style for rich collection view**

  Settings → Appearance gains a "Collection banner style" choice (shown
  while rich collection view is on): Classic, Comic, Sticker album,
  Brutalist and Strips. Every non-classic style shows a per-status summary
  of the collection — a proportional color bar with a dot-and-count legend,
  round status badges or boxy counters, depending on the style. Strips
  frames the photo as one full-bleed picture split by two slanted cuts.
  The comic and sticker styles draw on a fixed paper-and-ink palette; the
  others follow the app theme.

  * lib/shared/constants/rich_hero_style.dart (RichHeroStyle): New enum,
    id-keyed with a classic fallback in RichHeroStyle.fromId.
  * lib/shared/constants/rich_hero_style_ui.dart (RichHeroStyleUi.localizedLabel): New.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/rich/rich_hero_styles.dart
    (RichCollectionHero, _ComicHero, _StickerHero, _StickerHeroSide,
    _BrutalistHero, _SlatsHero, _HeroStats, _StatusBar, _StatusLegend,
    _StatusBadges, _ImageSlice, _HalftonePainter, _DotGridPainter,
    _PanelCutsPainter): New — the style dispatcher and the four
    non-classic banners.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/hero_image.dart (heroImageProviderFor,
    HeroCoverImage): New — shared hero ImageProvider resolution and the
    single cache-width policy for hero renders.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/rich/rich_collection_body.dart
    (RichHeroBanner): Reuse HeroCoverImage instead of a local copy.
  * lib/features/settings/providers/settings_provider.dart (SettingsKeys.richHeroStyle,
    SettingsState.richHeroStyle, SettingsNotifier.setRichHeroStyle,
    SettingsNotifier.clearSettings): New typed setting persisted in prefs.
  * lib/features/collections/providers/rich_collections_provider.dart
    (richHeroStyleProvider): New test-safe provider.
  * lib/features/settings/screens/settings_screen.dart
    (_SettingsScreenState._showRichHeroStylePicker): New picker tile.
  * lib/core/services/config_service.dart: Include the style key in the
    settings dump.
  * lib/l10n/app_*.arb: settingsRichHeroStyle* keys in all locales.

- **Audio as a new media type: music and podcasts**

  One "Audio" tab covers two kinds of records: music albums from
  MusicBrainz, with covers from Cover Art Archive and new-release /
  popularity data from ListenBrainz, and podcasts from Podcast Index.
  Search and browse with genre, type,
  year, category and language filters, two discover rows ("New releases"
  and "Trending podcasts"), and per-track / per-episode listened tracking:
  albums get the edition picker and its track list, podcasts get a dated
  episode checklist with year spans, progress bars, whole-span toggles and
  incremental pickup of newly published episodes. In a track or episode row
  the circle toggles the listened mark, and a tap on the row unfolds an
  ellipsized title. Cards title as
  "Artist — Album" / "Author — Podcast" and caption as "Music" / "Podcast".
  Statistics, export/import, backup and the selfhost web build all cover
  the new type.

  Podcast Index needs a key/secret pair: release builds ship with a
  built-in one, and Settings → Credentials or the welcome wizard accept a
  personal pair with a Test button; the keys travel with the settings dump
  and backups. On the selfhost web build the server signs proxied requests
  itself.

### Fixed

- **Statistics no longer count episodes and tracks of deleted titles**

  Every episode and track counter on the statistics page now ignores watch
  marks whose title is no longer in the collection. The marks themselves
  are kept, and a re-added series still comes back with its progress.

  * packages/core/lib/database/dao/stats_dao.dart (StatsDao.getEpisodeSplit,
    StatsDao.getListenedTrackTotal, StatsDao.getEstimatedMinutes,
    StatsDao.getEpisodesByMonth): Count only marks with a live tracker-backed
    item in the same collection — the rule CollectionItem.usesEpisodeTrackerFor
    applies, expressed as an EXISTS predicate.

- **A replaced cover on a custom card actually changes**

  Picking a new picture for a custom card — by URL or from disk — now
  replaces the shown cover immediately. "Refresh item" also shows the
  refetched cover right away instead of after a restart.

  * packages/core/lib/models/custom_media.dart (CustomMedia.localCoverMarkerFor,
    CustomMedia.localCoverToken): New — a marker that carries the pick's token.
  * packages/core/lib/utils/cover_image_id.dart (coverImageId,
    customCoverImageId): Suffix a custom cover's id with that token; the new
    accessor is what the call sites holding a card id use.
  * packages/core/lib/models/canvas_item.dart (CanvasItem.coverImageId): Use the
    shared builder so a canvas card resolves the same file.
  * lib/core/services/image_cache_service.dart
    (ImageCacheService.evictDecodedImage, ImageCacheService.deleteImage,
    ImageCacheService._serverImageUrl): Drop the replaced cover's decoded
    copies; delete through the server's cache on web.
  * lib/shared/widgets/cached_image.dart: Key Image.file by the source, so a
    file reused under one path is resolved again.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/create_custom_item_dialog.dart,
    lib/features/collections/screens/item_detail_screen.dart,
    lib/features/collections/providers/collections_provider.dart,
    lib/core/import/sources/custom_file/custom_cards_import_service.dart:
    Write the tokenized marker when a cover is picked or imported.
  * lib/features/collections/helpers/collection_actions.dart
    (CollectionActions._refreshItemWork): Evict the decoded copies before the
    refetch, so the new cover shows without a restart.
  * server/lib/src/image_handler.dart (ImageCache.deleteHandler,
    ImageCache._isSafeImageId), server/lib/src/app_handler.dart: A DELETE route
    for the image cache; the shared guard also rejects absolute and
    drive-qualified ids, which p.join would otherwise resolve outside the
    cache directory.

- **TheTVDB series show how many episodes they have**

  The progress badge and the season list of a TheTVDB series now show
  episode totals, counted from the episode list and skipping specials.

  * lib/core/api/episode_source/tvdb_episode_source.dart
    (TvdbEpisodeSource.getShow, TvdbEpisodeSource.getSeasons,
    TvdbEpisodeSource._episodeCountsBySeason): Fill in a missing total and the
    per-season counts; the list is fetched only when a season lacks its own.

- **Collection banner keeps its width in table view**

  Switching a rich collection to the table view keeps the banner full-bleed:
  the side padding now applies to the table alone.

  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_items_view.dart
    (CollectionItemsView.build): Stop padding the whole table view.

- **ScreenScraper works on the selfhost web build**

  Settings → API Keys on the web build now takes the ScreenScraper
  devid / devpassword pair, stores it on the server where the proxy reads
  it, and the gallery and the quota button follow what the server actually
  holds. Gallery media is served through the server's image cache, keyed
  per game, media type and region.

  * lib/shared/constants/api_defaults.dart (ApiDefaults.hasScreenScraperDevCreds):
    Build-time only again — the web build no longer claims a pair it cannot see.
  * lib/features/settings/providers/settings_provider.dart
    (SettingsKeys.screenScraperDevId, SettingsKeys.screenScraperDevPassword,
    SettingsState.hasScreenScraperDevCreds, SettingsState.canUseScreenScraper,
    SettingsNotifier.setScreenScraperDevCredentials): The pair as an ordinary
    credential — prefs on web, uploaded to the server, cleared with the rest,
    and an entered pair outranks the built-in one like every other key.
  * lib/core/selfhost/server_credentials.dart (kConfigKeyToCredential),
    lib/core/services/config_service.dart (_settingsKeys): Carry the two new
    keys, so a boot mirrors them back and a config dump round-trips them.
  * lib/core/api/screenscraper_api.dart (ScreenScraperApi.setDevCredentials,
    ScreenScraperApi.hasDevCredentials): Accept the pair at runtime instead of
    reading only the dart-define.
  * lib/features/collections/providers/screenscraper_provider.dart
    (ScreenScraperGameNotifier.build): Gate on SettingsState.canUseScreenScraper.
  * lib/features/settings/content/credentials_content.dart
    (_buildScreenScraperSection): Web-only devid / devpassword fields.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/screenscraper_gallery_section.dart
    (ssMediaUrl, ssMediaCacheId): Route media through the server's image cache
    on web, keyed per game, media type and region.
  * packages/core/lib/models/image_type.dart (ImageType.screenScraperMedia): New folder.
  * lib/core/services/screenscraper_cache_service.dart
    (ScreenScraperCacheService.read, ScreenScraperCacheService.isNegativelyCached):
    Skip the disk cache on web instead of throwing per lookup.
  * lib/l10n/app_*.arb: screenScraperDevCredsHint, screenScraperDevIdLabel,
    screenScraperDevPasswordLabel and their placeholders in all locales.

- **Selfhost server: an outage page is no longer cached as an image**

  The server's image cache refuses a body the source did not label
  `image/*`, so an HTML error page is never stored and served as a cover.

  * server/lib/src/image_handler.dart (ImageCache.handler): Refuse a body the
    source did not label `image/*`.

- **Item-card images load instantly from the cover cache**

  The cover and the blurred background of an item card render from the
  local cover cache on the first frame — no spinner on the collection →
  card transition and no second network fetch of an already-downloaded
  file. The grid, the card and the search sheet decode the poster at one
  width and share a single in-memory copy. On the web build the backdrop
  and the blurred poster load through the selfhost server's image cache,
  and the server paces its Cover Art Archive fetches.

  * lib/core/services/image_cache_service.dart
    (ImageCacheService.localPathIfCached, ImageCacheService.getBaseCachePath,
    ImageCacheService.isCacheEnabled): Memoize the base path and the enabled
    flag; new synchronous cache-hit lookup.
  * lib/shared/widgets/cached_image.dart (kPosterDecodeWidth,
    _CachedImageState._fetchImage, CachedImage.alignment): Resolve a cached
    file synchronously before the first frame; the shared poster decode
    width; alignment pass-through.
  * lib/shared/widgets/media_detail/media_cover_image.dart,
    lib/shared/widgets/media_poster_card.dart: Decode at kPosterDecodeWidth.
  * lib/shared/widgets/gyroscope_parallax_image.dart
    (GyroscopeParallaxImage.imageType, GyroscopeParallaxImage.imageId,
    GyroscopeParallaxImage._proxiedUrl): Render via CachedImage when the
    cache keys are given; route the URL fallback through imageProxyUrl on web.
  * lib/features/search/widgets/item_details_sheet.dart: Pass the poster's
    cache keys into the blurred-poster background; decode the poster at the
    shared width.
  * packages/core/lib/models/image_type.dart (ImageType.backdrop): New folder,
    keyed by a hash of the source URL.
  * server/lib/src/upstream_throttle.dart (UpstreamThrottle): Extracted from
    the proxy so both upstream paths share the FIFO gap.
  * server/lib/src/image_handler.dart (ImageCache.handler, _throttleHost):
    Pace coverartarchive.org fetches at the desktop client's gap.
  * server/lib/src/proxy_handler.dart: Use the extracted UpstreamThrottle.

- **Selfhost server: POST requests to external APIs are no longer rejected**

  The server proxy sends every forwarded body — including an empty one —
  with an explicit Content-Length instead of chunked transfer encoding.

  * server/lib/src/upstream_client.dart (HttpUpstreamClient._send): Set an
    explicit Content-Length on the forwarded body, including an empty one —
    an empty POST would otherwise still go out chunked.

- **Collection background image can be picked on the web build**

  Picking a hero image in the collection editor now works in a browser: the
  picked bytes upload to the selfhost server's image cache and the hero
  renders from its URL. A replaced or removed hero is deleted from the
  server cache, and an export on web skips the hero file.

  * packages/core/lib/models/image_type.dart (ImageType.collectionHero): New folder.
  * packages/core/lib/api/image_proxy.dart (imageProxyUrl): New — the
    origin-prefixed form of imageProxyPath every fetch and upload now uses.
  * lib/core/services/collection_hero_service.dart (CollectionHeroService.pickAndSave,
    CollectionHeroService.saveBytes, CollectionHeroService.resolve,
    CollectionHeroService.delete): Web branches — upload via
    ImageCacheService.saveImageBytes, resolve to the server URL, and delete
    a replaced or removed hero from the server cache instead of leaking it.
  * lib/core/services/export_service.dart (ExportService._collectHeroImage):
    Skip the hero on web — the resolved location is a URL, and reading it as
    a file broke every export of a collection with a background.
  * lib/core/services/image_cache_service.dart (ImageCacheService.saveImageBytes),
    lib/shared/widgets/cached_image.dart, lib/features/collections/widgets/create_custom_item_dialog.dart:
    Switch to imageProxyUrl.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_hero_background.dart
    (CollectionHeroBackground): Render through heroImageProviderFor so a
    URL hero works.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/edit_collection_dialog.dart: Show the
    Choose/Replace/Remove image controls on web — the picker no longer
    needs a local filesystem.

- **Import no longer stamps today's date into empty started/completed fields**

  An item exported with a status but no dates now imports with its dates
  empty: the file's dates win verbatim, including explicit nulls.

  * lib/core/services/import_service.dart (ImportService._restoreUserData):
    Passes clearStartedAt / clearCompletedAt when the exported item carries a
    status but no dates, undoing the stamp the status write just made.

### Changed

- **Performance improvements**

  Faster sorting on large collections and smoother "All items" grid,
  selection mode and scrolling.

- **The collection banner carries the title and the back arrow**

  With rich collection view on, the plain title row above a collection is
  gone: the banner itself shows the name and a back control drawn in its own
  style — an inked plate in Comic, a taped-on circle in Sticker album, a
  hard-shadowed square in Brutalist, a quiet rounded one in Strips and a
  scrim circle over the photo in Classic. The banner also stays up while
  the items are still loading or failed to load.

  * lib/features/collections/widgets/rich/hero_back_button.dart
    (HeroBackButton): New — one back control the styles decorate themselves.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/rich/rich_hero_styles.dart
    (RichCollectionHero, _ComicHero, _StickerHero, _BrutalistHero, _SlatsHero):
    Take an optional onBack and place it in each style's own frame.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/rich/rich_collection_body.dart
    (RichHeroBanner): Same for the classic banner.
  * lib/features/collections/screens/collection_screen.dart
    (_CollectionScreenState._isRich, _CollectionScreenState.build,
    _CollectionScreenState._buildListLayout): Hide SubScreenTitleBar when the
    banner carries the title; keep the banner above the loading skeleton and
    the error state.

- **One poster-grid geometry for every card grid and its skeleton**

  A collection, All Items, search, browse and the audio discover rows share
  one poster-grid geometry — column count, spacing and padding — and the
  loading skeleton reads the same numbers, so placeholders match the cards
  that replace them. Search gains the landscape-phone density, the tablet
  breakpoint and the compact card form.

  * lib/shared/utils/poster_grid_delegate.dart (posterGridGeometry): New —
    delegate plus outer padding for one card scale, replacing posterGridDelegate.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_items_view.dart
    (CollectionItemsView._buildGridView),
    lib/features/home/screens/all_items_screen.dart
    (_AllItemsScreenState._buildGroupedGrid),
    lib/features/search/widgets/browse_grid.dart (BrowseGrid._gridGeometry,
    BrowseGrid._buildShimmerGrid),
    lib/features/search/widgets/audio_discover_feed.dart (AudioDiscoverFeed._grid):
    Delete the local geometry and read the shared one.
  * lib/shared/widgets/shimmer_loading.dart (ShimmerPosterGrid): Becomes a
    ConsumerWidget reading the same geometry and card scale.
  * lib/shared/constants/platform_features.dart (useCompactCard): New — the one
    predicate cards and skeletons share.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_table/collection_table_view.dart
    (CollectionTableView.build): Side padding moves onto the toolbar and grid so
    the banner above them stays full-bleed.

- **Less animation work on mobile**

  A blurred-poster backdrop no longer follows the gyroscope. A tagged
  card's running border highlight is drawn statically on phones. Shimmer
  placeholders share a single animation clock instead of one controller
  each, and stop ticking once the content arrives.

  * lib/shared/widgets/gyroscope_parallax_image.dart
    (GyroscopeParallaxImage.enabled): New flag that skips the sensor entirely.
  * lib/features/search/widgets/item_details_sheet.dart: Pass enabled: false in
    the blurred-poster fallback.
  * lib/shared/widgets/media_poster_card.dart (_TagGlowWrapperState._syncController,
    _GlowBorderPainter): No controller on mobile; a null progress paints the
    border without the sweep.
  * lib/shared/widgets/shimmer_loading.dart (_ShimmerTimeline, _ShimmerBoxState):
    One refcounted Ticker driving a shared phase, gated by TickerMode.

- **Status filter takes several statuses at once**

  The status dropdown above a collection and above All Items is now
  multi-select: the menu stays open while ticking statuses, an item passes
  when it matches any of them, and the segment reads "Statuses: N" once more
  than one is picked. "All" clears the selection. The choice on All Items is
  remembered per profile as before, now as the whole set, and a single status
  saved by an older build is carried over on first launch.

  * lib/shared/widgets/chevron_filter_bar.dart (StatusDropdownSegment,
    _StatusMenuList, _StatusMenuRow): Take and report a `Set<ItemStatus>`;
    the menu body toggles rows without closing the popup and derives its
    order from ItemStatus.statusSortPriority.
  * lib/features/collections/providers/collections_provider.dart
    (HomeStatusFilterNotifier, filteredCollectionIdsProvider): Persist a
    string list under `home_status_filters_{profileId}`, falling back once to
    the older single-value key.
  * lib/features/collections/helpers/collection_filters.dart
    (CollectionFilters.statuses): Replace the single `status` with an OR set.
  * lib/features/collections/screens/collection_screen.dart
    (_CollectionScreenState._filterStatuses,
    _CollectionScreenState._effectiveStatusesForChevrons),
    lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_filter_bar.dart
    (CollectionFilterBar.filterStatuses, CollectionFilterBar.effectiveStatusesForCounts),
    lib/features/home/screens/all_items_screen.dart
    (_AllItemsScreenState._matchesNonTypeFilters): Thread the set through
    filtering and the chevron counts.
  * packages/core/lib/database/dao/collection_dao.dart
    (CollectionDao.getCollectionIdsWithStatuses): Replaces
    getCollectionIdsWithStatus — one `IN (…)` query instead of one call per
    status; RPC layer regenerated.
  * lib/l10n/app_*.arb: statusFilterSelected in all locales.

- **Subfilter bar sits flush with the content below**

  The media-type subfilter row lost its bottom padding, removing the
  double gap between the chips and the collection header.

  * lib/shared/widgets/filter_subfilter_bar.dart (SubfilterBar): Drop the
    outer and inner bottom insets.

- **Tag dialogs unified: search, in-place editing and persisted sorting everywhere**

  "Manage tags" and the "Select tags" picker now share one body: a search
  field that filters as you type and quick-creates via a "Create «…»" row,
  and a sort menu — manual (drag order), A–Z or Z–A — whose choice is
  remembered per profile and also orders the tag chip bar above a
  collection and the narrow-screen filter sheet. Picker rows carry the full
  editing set (background/text color dots, rename, delete, usage counts) —
  those edits apply to the tag itself immediately, independent of the
  checkbox selection. Creating a duplicate tag is no longer possible: the
  create row hides when a name matches case-insensitively, and the database
  layer resolves a racing insert to the existing tag.

  * lib/features/collections/widgets/tag_search_list.dart (TagSearchList): New —
    shared search/create/sort body of both dialogs.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/tag_row.dart (TagRow, TagEditActions,
    TagColorDot): New — shared editable row and the rename/recolor/delete flows.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/tag_picker_dialog.dart (TagPickerDialog):
    Rebuilt on TagSearchList + TagRow; prunes deleted ids before returning.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/tag_management_dialog.dart
    (TagManagementDialog): Rebuilt on TagSearchList + TagRow.
  * packages/core/lib/models/tag_sort_mode.dart (TagSortMode): New — sort
    modes with the list-ordering logic.
  * lib/shared/constants/tag_sort_mode_ui.dart (TagSortModeUi.localizedLabel):
    New.
  * lib/features/collections/providers/tag_sort_provider.dart
    (TagSortModeNotifier): New — per-profile persistence of the sort mode.
  * lib/features/collections/providers/item_tags_provider.dart
    (tagUsageCountsProvider): New — tag id → item count derivation.
  * lib/features/collections/screens/collection_screen.dart
    (_CollectionScreenState._visibleTags): Applies the shared sort mode to
    the chip bar and the filter sheet.
  * packages/core/lib/database/dao/global_tag_dao.dart (GlobalTagDao.create):
    Adopts the existing row on a UNIQUE name conflict.
  * lib/shared/widgets/color_picker_dialog.dart (ColorPickerDialog.storedValue):
    New helper mapping a pick to its stored ARGB value.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, app_ru.arb, app_es.arb, app_fr.arb, app_pt.arb,
    app_zh.arb: tagSortTooltip, tagSortManual, tagSortAlphaAsc,
    tagSortAlphaDesc.
  * test/features/collections/widgets/tag_search_list_test.dart,
    tag_picker_dialog_test.dart, tag_management_dialog_test.dart,
    test/features/collections/providers/tag_sort_provider_test.dart,
    packages/core/test/models/tag_sort_mode_test.dart: New.
  * test/features/collections/widgets/dialogs/tag_picker_dialog_test.dart:
    Deleted — folded into the mirrored-path picker test above.

- **Tags on wide screens move from the vertical side rail to a horizontal chip bar**

  The vertical tag rail on the right edge is gone. Tags are now a single
  chip row above the items grid: horizontal labels with per-collection item
  counts, the same multi-select toggling, a reset chip showing how many
  tags are active, and the "Group" toggle first in the row. When the chips
  overflow, the row scrolls sideways via edge-fade arrows (desktop), the
  mouse wheel, or touch/mouse drag. Narrow screens keep the tags-and-sorting
  sheet behind the filter-bar button.

  * lib/features/collections/widgets/tag_top_bar.dart (TagTopBar): New —
    chip row on ScrollableRowWithArrows.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/tag_sidebar.dart (TagSidebar): Deleted.
  * lib/features/collections/screens/collection_screen.dart
    (_CollectionScreenState._buildListLayout, _CollectionScreenState._countItemTags,
    _CollectionScreenState._handleTagToggled, _CollectionScreenState._handleGroupToggled):
    Layout goes from a side-rail Row to a top-bar Column; per-tag counts are
    computed here; the tag/group toggle handlers are shared between the
    filter bar and the new top bar.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_filter_bar.dart: Comment
    update only.
  * test/features/collections/widgets/tag_top_bar_test.dart: New.

## [0.42.0] - 2026-08-11

### Added

- **TheTVDB as a source for movies and TV series**

  Two new providers in search and browse, backed by your own TheTVDB v4 key
  (Settings → Credentials, with a Test button and reset to the built-in key).
  Both support search and filtered browse by genre and year, and series bring
  their own seasons and episodes to the episode tracker. TheTVDB publishes no
  user rating, so its titles carry no rating badge. Without a key the two chips
  start switched off instead of failing every request.

  Movies became multi-source in the process: provider id spaces overlap, so a
  TheTVDB movie would have replaced the TMDB movie with the same number in the
  cache. Every read path that resolves a film — collection lists, cover
  mosaics, mood grids, statistics, export — now carries the provider alongside
  the id. Movie cover files are namespaced by provider too, so cached posters
  are re-downloaded once after the upgrade.

  * packages/core/lib/database/migrations/migration_v62.dart (MigrationV62):
    New — rebuilds `movies_cache` with `PRIMARY KEY (tmdb_id, source)` and
    re-scopes the `collection_items` indexes so one film can come from two
    providers.
  * packages/core/lib/database/migrations/migration_registry.dart
    (MigrationRegistry.all): Registers MigrationV62.
  * packages/core/lib/models/data_source.dart (DataSource.tvdb): New source.
  * packages/core/lib/models/movie.dart (Movie.source, Movie.fromTvdb,
    Movie.fromDb, Movie.toDb, Movie.copyWith, Movie.posterThumbUrl): Identity is
    now `(source, id)`; TheTVDB posters use the `_t` thumbnail suffix.
  * packages/core/lib/models/media_type.dart (MediaType.isMultiSource): Includes
    movie.
  * packages/core/lib/models/collection_item.dart (CollectionItem._resolvedMedia):
    Reads the movie's own source instead of assuming TMDB.
  * packages/core/lib/models/tv_show.dart (TvShow.fromTvdb),
    tv_season.dart (TvSeason.fromTvdb), tv_episode.dart (TvEpisode.tryFromTvdb):
    New factories.
  * packages/core/lib/utils/tvdb_json.dart (tvdbNumericId, tvdbTranslation,
    tvdbTranslationContainers, tvdbImageUrl, tvdbThumbUrl, tvdbRemoteId,
    tvdbNames, tvdbYear, tvdbCodesFor, tvdbRecordUrl): New — TheTVDB never
    localizes a response, and `/filter` returns bare image paths while
    `/search` returns absolute URLs.
  * packages/core/lib/database/sparse_upsert.dart (buildPreservingUpsert): New
    — a cache upsert that keeps columns a sparser payload left null.
  * lib/features/search/filters/tvdb_status_filter.dart (TvdbStatusFilter):
    New; lib/l10n/app_*.arb (movieStatusReleased, movieStatusCompleted,
    movieStatusPostProduction, movieStatusPreProduction,
    movieStatusAnnounced): Movie production-status labels.
  * packages/core/lib/database/dao/movie_dao.dart (MovieDao.getMovieByTmdbId,
    MovieDao.upsertMovie, MovieDao.upsertMovies): Keyed by id and source, with a
    preserving upsert so a search hit cannot blank a cached runtime or overview.
  * packages/core/lib/database/dao/collection_dao.dart
    (CollectionDao.getCollectionCovers, CollectionDao._loadJoinedData),
    packages/core/lib/database/dao/stats_dao.dart
    (StatsDao.getEstimatedMinutes): Source-qualified `movies_cache` joins — an
    unqualified one matched both providers' rows, duplicating a cover and
    double-counting a film's runtime.
  * lib/core/services/export_service.dart
    (ExportService._collectMediaData): Keys exported movies by `source:id` so
    two providers' films both survive a full export.
  * lib/features/mood_grids/widgets/mood_grid_cell_media.dart,

    (CanvasRepository._loadMediaData),

    lib/features/recommendations/widgets/recommendation_row.dart: Resolve and
    cache a film by provider, not by id alone.
  * lib/core/import/import_writer.dart (ImportWriter.itemKey,
    ImportWriteResult.idFor, ImportCandidate.source),
    lib/core/import/sources/hardcover/hardcover_import_service.dart,
    lib/core/import/sources/simkl/simkl_import_service.dart: Import identity
    includes the provider, matching the unique index — a re-import no longer
    updates another provider's row that shares the numeric id.
  * lib/core/services/kodi_sync_service.dart (KodiSyncService._doSync,
    KodiSyncService._syncItemToCollection): Kodi resolves to TMDB ids, so its
    lookups and inserts are pinned to TMDB.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/recommendations_section.dart,
    lib/features/search/widgets/discover_feed.dart,
    lib/features/recommendations/providers/recommendations_provider.dart
    (collectedRecommendationIdsProvider),

    (_ItemDetailScreenState._addRecommendation): The "already in collection"
    mark on a TMDB recommendation only counts TMDB placements.
  * lib/core/api/tvdb/tvdb_http_client.dart (TvdbHttpClient): New — exchanges the
    key for a bearer token, re-logs in once on 401 and retries.
  * lib/core/api/tvdb/tvdb_search_api.dart (TvdbSearchApi),
    tvdb_movies_api.dart (TvdbMoviesApi), tvdb_series_api.dart (TvdbSeriesApi),

    (BrowseNotifier._keylessSourceIds): A provider without its mandatory key
    starts switched off.

- **Hidden collections — keep a collection out of sight without deleting it**

  A collection can be marked hidden through right-click / long-press on its
  card, the checkbox in the New Collection dialog, or the Edit dialog. It stays
  in the list under its own name and count, but its card shows a placeholder
  instead of the cover mosaic, and its titles drop out of the All Items screen
  and the preference cloud. Everything else behaves normally: the collection
  opens as usual, stays a target in every collection picker, still counts in
  Statistics, and exports without the flag. Toggling applies instantly, in both
  directions, without re-reading the database. A full backup remembers which
  collections were hidden and re-hides them on restore.

  * packages/core/lib/database/migrations/migration_v61.dart (MigrationV61):
    New — adds the `is_hidden` column to `collections`.
  * packages/core/lib/database/migrations/migration_registry.dart
    (MigrationRegistry.all): Registers MigrationV61.
  * packages/core/lib/models/collection.dart (Collection.isHidden,
    Collection.fromDb, Collection.toDb, Collection.copyWith,
    Collection.internalDbFields): Stores the flag as INTEGER 0/1 and keeps it
    out of the export payload — a shared collection is not hidden for its
    receiver.
  * packages/core/lib/database/dao/collection_dao.dart
    (CollectionDao.createCollection, CollectionDao.updateCollection): Writes
    and toggles the flag.
  * lib/core/database/database_service.dart (DatabaseService.createCollection,
    DatabaseService.updateCollection),
    lib/data/repositories/collection_repository.dart
    (CollectionRepository.create, CollectionRepository.setHidden,
    CollectionRepository.updatePersonalization): Pass the flag through.
  * lib/features/collections/providers/collections_provider.dart
    (CollectionsNotifier.create, CollectionsNotifier.setHidden,
    CollectionsNotifier.updatePersonalization): Writes the flag and patches the
    in-memory list so the card updates without a reload.
  * lib/features/home/providers/all_items_provider.dart
    (hiddenCollectionIdsProvider, visibleAllItemsProvider): New — filters the
    loaded library above AllItemsNotifier, so toggling never hits the database
    and CacheCleanupService still sees every item.
  * lib/features/home/screens/all_items_screen.dart (_AllItemsScreenState.build):
    Reads visibleAllItemsProvider and clears the bulk selection when the hidden
    set changes.
  * lib/features/genre_cloud/providers/genre_cloud_provider.dart
    (genreCloudItemsProvider),
    lib/features/recommendations/providers/recommendations_provider.dart
    (recommendationsProvider): Read the filtered library.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_card.dart (CollectionCard.build):
    A hidden collection never renders the rich hero card.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/classic/classic_collection_card.dart
    (ClassicCollectionCard.build, _HiddenPlaceholder): Skips the cover query and
    draws a placeholder.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_list_tile.dart
    (CollectionListTile.build): Hidden collections get a different leading icon.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/hidden_collection_checkbox.dart
    (HiddenCollectionCheckbox): New — shared by the create and edit dialogs.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/create_collection_dialog.dart
    (CreateCollectionResult, CreateCollectionDialog.show,
    _CreateCollectionDialogState._submit): The dialog returns name plus flag
    instead of a bare name.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/edit_collection_dialog.dart
    (_EditCollectionDialogState._save): Saves the flag when it changed.
  * lib/features/collections/screens/home_screen.dart
    (_HomeScreenState._createCollection,
    _HomeScreenState._showCollectionContextMenu,
    _HomeScreenState._showCollectionOptions): Hide / Unhide in the right-click
    menu and the long-press sheet.
  * packages/core/lib/testing/builders.dart (createTestCollection): Accepts
    isHidden.
  * lib/core/services/backup_service.dart (BackupManifest.hiddenCollections,
    BackupService.createBackup, BackupService.restoreFromBackup): The manifest
    lists hidden collections; restore re-applies the flag after import.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, app_ru.arb, app_es.arb, app_fr.arb, app_pt.arb,
    app_zh.arb (createCollectionHiddenLabel, createCollectionHiddenHint,
    collectionHide, collectionUnhide): New keys.

- **Sakura theme — a soft light theme, switchable in Settings → Appearance**

  The app is no longer dark-only: a Theme picker offers Dark (unchanged) and
  Sakura — a light pink palette with darkened media-type accents, its own
  rose-tinted background wallpaper, and pink counter badges. The whole design
  now lives in one palette file; every widget reads colors through theme-aware
  tokens, so future themes are a single palette definition. Switching applies
  instantly and returns the app to the home screen.

  * lib/shared/theme/app_palette.dart (AppPalette, AppPalette.dark,
    AppPalette.sakura): New — every color of a theme in one place, plus
    semantic tokens (scrim, onOverlay, onBrand, shadow, barrier, badge,
    ratingGold, rowFade) and the wallpaper tile (tileAsset, tileOpacity,
    tileImage).
  * lib/shared/theme/app_colors.dart (AppColors): Static consts became getters
    delegating to the active palette.
  * lib/shared/theme/app_theme.dart (AppTheme.build): ThemeData is built from
    a palette; badge and error colors follow it.
  * lib/shared/theme/app_theme_id.dart (AppThemeId): New — theme registry and
    SharedPreferences id.
  * lib/shared/theme/app_typography.dart (AppTypography): Styles became
    getters so text colors follow a theme switch.
  * lib/features/settings/providers/settings_provider.dart
    (SettingsNotifier.setAppTheme, SettingsState.appTheme): Theme setting.
  * lib/features/settings/screens/settings_screen.dart
    (_SettingsScreenState._showThemePicker,
    _SettingsScreenState._showChoicePicker): Theme tile in Appearance; the
    five choice dialogs share one generic picker.
  * lib/app.dart (TonkatsuBoxApp): Swaps the palette and rebuilds the
    MaterialApp subtree on theme change.
  * assets/images/background_tile_sakura.png: New — the wallpaper tile
    recolored to sakura rose.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, app_ru.arb, app_es.arb, app_fr.arb, app_pt.arb,
    app_zh.arb (settingsTheme, settingsThemeSubtitle, settingsThemeDark,
    settingsThemeSakura): New keys.
  * ~140 widget files: hardcoded Colors.* / Color(0x...) replaced with the
    semantic palette tokens above; `const` dropped where color expressions are
    no longer compile-time constants.

- **Anime and manga recommendations — in the item card and on the Personalization tab**

  An anime's detail page now shows a "Similar" carousel: AniList's community
  recommendations rendered as Kitsu titles, so an added pick keeps seasons and
  the episode tracker. The manga "Similar" carousel, previously limited to
  MangaBaka and MangaDex entries, now also works for manga added from AniList
  and Kitsu. The Personalization → Recommendations tab learns two new taste
  domains next to movies/TV: anime (from completed AniList titles) and manga
  (per source — MangaBaka, MangaDex, AniList), each with its own "because you
  liked" rows. All new sources are keyless — no API key required.

  * lib/core/api/anilist/anilist_queries.dart
    (AniListQueries.recommendationsBatch, AniListQueries.recommendationAlias):
    New Media.recommendations query, rating-sorted, capped at AniList's nested
    perPage of 25; one aliased block per seed so a whole seed set costs a
    single request against the 30/min rate limit.
  * lib/core/api/anilist/anilist_media_parser.dart
    (AniListMediaParser.recommendedAnimeBatch,
    AniListMediaParser.recommendedMangaBatch): Map recommendation nodes per
    seed, dropping deleted media and cross-type entries.
  * lib/core/api/anilist/anilist_media_api.dart, lib/core/api/anilist_api.dart
    (AniListApi.getAnimeRecommendations, AniListApi.getMangaRecommendations,
    AniListApi.getAnimeRecommendationsBatch,
    AniListApi.getMangaRecommendationsBatch): New; retried on a 429.
  * lib/core/api/kitsu/kitsu_mapping_api.dart (KitsuMappingApi.getAniListId,
    KitsuMappingApi.siteAniListAnime, KitsuMappingApi.siteAniListManga),
    lib/core/api/kitsu_api.dart (KitsuApi.getAniListAnimeId,
    KitsuApi.getAniListMangaId, KitsuApi.getAnimeByAniListIds): Kitsu↔AniList
    id bridges over the mappings endpoints, both directions.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/anime_similars_section.dart
    (AnimeSimilarsSection): New. AniList seed queried directly, Kitsu seed
    bridged first; candidates resolved back to Kitsu entities, unmapped ones
    dropped.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/manga_similars_section.dart
    (mangaSimilarsSources, MangaSimilarsSection): AniList and Kitsu seed
    routing; owned badge matches the candidates' source.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/similars_poster_row.dart
    (SimilarsPosterRow, SimilarsPosterRowShimmer, SimilarCardData): New shared
    carousel replacing the per-section row/shimmer copies.
  * lib/features/collections/screens/item_detail_screen.dart
    (_ItemDetailScreenState._addAnimeFromSimilars): New add-to-collection
    handler; anime/manga similars gating.
  * lib/features/recommendations/anime_taste_input.dart (animeTasteId,
    tasteTitleFromAnimeItem, tasteTitleFromAnime, ownedAnimeTasteIds),
    lib/features/recommendations/manga_taste_input.dart (mangaTasteId,
    mangaTasteSources, tasteTitleFromMangaItem, tasteTitleFromManga,
    ownedMangaTasteIds), lib/features/recommendations/taste_features.dart
    (buildNameFeatureTitle): New engine adapters; genres+tags matched by
    source-native names, vocabularies never mixed across sources.
  * lib/features/recommendations/providers/recommendations_provider.dart
    (recommendationsProvider, RecommendedItem, RecommendationStatus,
    collectedRecommendationIdsProvider): Split into independent concurrent
    domains (movie/TV, anime, manga); a domain with nothing to say contributes
    no rows; the TMDB key gates only the movie/TV domain. RecommendedItem
    carries source + externalId instead of a TMDB-only id.
  * lib/features/recommendations/widgets/recommendation_row.dart
    (RecommendationRowWidget): Poster cache type/id, placeholder icon and
    source badge follow the item's media type and source.
  * test/core/api/anilist/anilist_media_parser_test.dart,
    test/core/api/anilist_api_test.dart,
    test/core/api/kitsu/kitsu_mapping_api_test.dart,
    test/features/collections/widgets/anime_similars_section_test.dart,
    test/features/collections/widgets/manga_similars_section_test.dart,
    test/features/recommendations/anime_taste_input_test.dart,
    test/features/recommendations/manga_taste_input_test.dart,
    test/features/recommendations/providers/recommendations_provider_test.dart:
    New coverage — batch parser mapping, bridges, per-source routing, owned
    matching, adapters, multi-domain partial results and status precedence.

- **"No date" option for the started / completed dates**

  An already-set date can now be erased from the date picker — for media
  consumed long ago whose dates nobody remembers. Clearing a date never
  touches the item's status (a film stays completed with an unknown watch
  date), and the usual automation is intact: setting a date still syncs the
  status, and status changes still fill the dates.

  * lib/shared/widgets/dual_date_picker_dialog.dart (DualDateResult,
    showDualDatePickerResult, DualDatePickerDialog.allowClear): New result
    wrapper distinguishing "cleared" from "cancelled"; the "No date" action
    shows only when the dialog is opened over an existing date. The original
    showDualDatePicker contract is unchanged for its other callers.
  * lib/shared/widgets/media_detail_view.dart (OnActivityDateChanged,
    _MediaDetailViewState._pickActivityDate): The callback date is nullable —
    null means "clear the field".
  * lib/features/collections/screens/item_detail_screen.dart
    (_ItemDetailScreenState._updateActivityDate): Routes a null date into the
    clear flags.
  * lib/features/collections/providers/collections_provider.dart
    (CollectionItemsNotifier.updateActivityDates),
    lib/data/repositories/collection_repository.dart,
    lib/core/database/database_service.dart,
    packages/core/lib/database/dao/collection_dao.dart
    (CollectionDao.updateItemActivityDates): New clearStartedAt /
    clearCompletedAt flags — a plain null still means "leave unchanged";
    clearing bypasses the date→status sync on purpose.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, app_es.arb, app_fr.arb, app_pt.arb, app_ru.arb,
    app_zh.arb (dualDatePickerNoDate): New.
  * test/shared/widgets/dual_date_picker_dialog_test.dart,
    test/shared/widgets/media_detail_view_test.dart,
    test/features/collections/providers/collections_provider_test.dart,
    test/core/database/dao/collection_dao_test.dart,
    packages/core/test/database/dao/collection_dao_status_dates_test.dart:
    Clear-flow coverage — the button appears only over a set date, clearing
    writes NULL and never calls updateItemStatus.

- **Selfhost: run Tonkatsu Box in a browser via Docker**

  `docker compose up -d --build` on your own machine or home server, then open
  `http://<server-ip>:8080` from any device. It is the same app, in a browser:
  the database, cover cache and API keys live on the server, so every device
  works with the same library. Setup, configuration, HTTPS and backups are
  described in README → Self-Hosting.

  Not available in the browser: VGMaps, Discord Rich Presence, Kodi, gamepad,
  LAN sync, profiles, the data folder and collection hero images. Everything
  else works as in the desktop app.

### Changed

- **Collection cards redesigned: a pile of covers with media-type badges**

  A grid card now throws up to eight covers into a casual pile — every
  collection keeps its own stable arrangement — and the pile gathers into a
  neat cascaded deck on hover or gamepad focus. The top card carries a "+N"
  badge for items beyond the visible covers. Colored dots in the corner mark
  the media types inside (dominant first, "+N" overflow past five), and a thin
  spectrum strip under the stats shows the type proportions, like a language
  bar. Rich cards and the list view get the same dots.

  * lib/features/collections/widgets/deck/deck_collection_card.dart
    (DeckCollectionCard, _CoverPile, _FanPoster, _StatsLine): New — replaces
    the 3+3 cover mosaic as the grid card.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/classic/classic_collection_card.dart
    (ClassicCollectionCard): Removed together with the mosaic design.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/media_type_dots.dart (MediaTypeDots):
    New — avatar-stack of circular per-type badges.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/media_type_spectrum_bar.dart
    (MediaTypeSpectrumBar): New — proportional per-type accent strip.
  * lib/data/repositories/collection_repository.dart
    (CollectionStats.mediaTypeCounts, CollectionStats.presentMediaTypes):
    New getters — per-type counts and dominant-first present types.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_card.dart
    (CollectionCard.build): Dispatches to DeckCollectionCard.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_card_overlay.dart
    (CollectionCardOverlay.build): Dots in the top-right corner of rich
    cards; CollectionCardBottomScrim removed with the mosaic.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_list_tile.dart
    (CollectionListTile.build): Dots as the trailing widget.
  * lib/features/collections/providers/collection_covers_provider.dart
    (collectionCoversProvider): Cover limit 6 → 9 so the pile has depth.

- **Copy the Simkl pairing code with one tap**

  The code block on the Simkl import screen gets a copy button, so the code no
  longer has to be retyped by hand into simkl.com/pin.

  * lib/features/settings/content/simkl_import_content.dart
    (_SimklImportContentState._buildPinBlock,
    _SimklImportContentState._copyPin): Copy button next to the code, with a
    confirmation snack.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, app_ru.arb, app_es.arb, app_fr.arb, app_pt.arb,
    app_zh.arb (simklPinCopied): New string.

### Removed

- **Drop orphaned widgets left behind by earlier redesigns**

  `ActivityDatesSection` was superseded by the dates row inside
  `MediaDetailView`, and the grouped `SourceDropdown` by the search source
  tabs; both had no remaining call sites. The source-grouping metadata that
  existed only for the dropdown goes with it, and the activity-date callback
  contract the section shared becomes a proper enum instead of a raw string.

  * lib/features/collections/widgets/activity_dates_section.dart
    (ActivityDatesSection, _DateRow): Removed.
  * lib/features/search/widgets/source_dropdown.dart (SourceDropdown,
    _sourceGlyph): Removed.
  * lib/features/search/sources/search_sources.dart (groupedSearchSources,
    SourceGroupEntry): Removed with their only consumer.
  * lib/features/search/models/search_source.dart (SearchSource.groupId,
    SearchSource.groupName, SearchSource.groupIcon): Removed — DataSource.key
    and DataSource.label already carry the provider identity.
  * lib/features/search/sources/anilist_anime_source.dart,
    anilist_manga_source.dart, comicvine_source.dart, fantlab_source.dart,
    google_books_source.dart, hardcover_source.dart, igdb_games_source.dart,
    kitsu_anime_source.dart, kitsu_manga_source.dart, mangabaka_source.dart,
    mangadex_source.dart, openlibrary_source.dart, tmdb_anime_source.dart,
    tmdb_movies_source.dart, tmdb_tv_source.dart, tvmaze_tv_source.dart,
    vndb_source.dart: Drop the groupIcon override.
  * lib/shared/widgets/media_detail_view.dart (ActivityDateField,
    OnActivityDateChanged),
    lib/features/collections/screens/item_detail_screen.dart
    (_ItemDetailScreenState._updateActivityDate): The started / completed
    selector in the activity-date callback is the new ActivityDateField enum
    instead of a 'started' / 'completed' string.
  * test/features/collections/widgets/activity_dates_section_test.dart,
    test/features/search/widgets/source_dropdown_test.dart,
    test/features/search/sources/search_sources_grouping_test.dart: Removed
    with the widgets.

### Fixed

- **Watched Date set in the past was overwritten with the current date**

  Setting a Watched/Completed date on an item that was not yet completed
  auto-promoted its status, and the completed transition stamped
  `completed_at = now` over the just-saved user date. The UI kept showing the
  chosen date until the list reloaded (e.g. after adding another film), which
  made the overwrite look like it happened on add.

  * lib/features/collections/providers/collections_provider.dart
    (CollectionItemsNotifier.updateActivityDates): The status auto-update is
    written strictly before the explicit dates, so the user's date always
    lands last.
  * test/features/collections/providers/collections_provider_test.dart:
    Regression group pinning the repository write order.
  * packages/core/test/database/dao/collection_dao_status_dates_test.dart:
    New. Documents the DAO semantics (completed transition stamps now) that
    make the ordering mandatory.

## [0.41.0] - 2026-08-04

### Added

- **Source logo on poster cards, linking to the item's page**

  Every card in a collection, in search results and in the recommendation and
  discover rows now opens its meta line with the logo of the source the entry
  came from — AniList, MangaDex, IGDB, TMDB and the rest — so it is clear at a
  glance where a title is tracked. Clicking the logo opens that title's page on
  the source in a browser; entries without a link (local and custom items) keep
  the logo as a plain marker. Hovering it shows the source name. The bundled
  brand logos were also trimmed of their empty margins and brought to one
  256×256 canvas, so they read at the small sizes a card uses.

  * lib/shared/widgets/media_poster_card.dart (MediaPosterCard.source,
    MediaPosterCard.onSourceTap, _MediaPosterCardState._buildSubtitleRow,
    _MediaPosterCardState._buildMetaText, _SourceLogoLink): New. The logo sits
    in a Row beside the meta text rather than in a WidgetSpan, which would grow
    the text line past the title block's fixed height.
  * lib/shared/utils/url_launch.dart (openUrlCallback): New. Returns a tap
    handler, or null when the item has no external page.
  * lib/features/recommendations/providers/recommendations_provider.dart
    (RecommendedItem.externalUrl): New getter resolving the page of the
    underlying Movie / TvShow.
  * lib/features/search/widgets/discover_row.dart (DiscoverItem.externalUrl),
    lib/features/collections/widgets/recommendations_section.dart
    (_RecItem.source, _RecItem.externalUrl): New fields carrying the link to
    the card.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_items_view.dart
    (CollectionItemsView), lib/features/home/screens/all_items_screen.dart
    (_AllItemsScreenState), lib/features/search/widgets/browse_grid.dart

- **Simkl import — movies, TV shows and anime from one account**

  A new import source in Settings → Import. Sign-in is a short code: the app
  shows a 5-character PIN, you confirm it at simkl.com/pin — no password and
  no API token to paste — and the screen shows which account got connected
  before anything is imported, with an optional "stay connected" toggle for
  next time. One import brings the whole Simkl library: movies, TV shows and
  anime arrive together with statuses, ratings and notes. Episode history
  comes over episode-by-episode with the original watch dates, so the episode
  tracker and the card progress match Simkl right away; the progress panel
  reports that pass title by title, since a large account takes a while.
  Anime is matched by
  id against the anime catalog (no title guessing) and lands with the full
  episode tracker; Simkl's "on hold" entries arrive as planned with an
  `on-hold` tag. The usual import controls apply — "only new" or "overwrite"
  mode, a new or existing target collection — and anything that cannot be
  matched is kept in the wishlist under the import tag instead of being
  dropped.

  * lib/core/api/simkl_api.dart (SimklApi, simklApiProvider): New. PIN flow
    (requestPin, pollPin), getUserSettings, getAllItems.
  * lib/core/api/simkl/simkl_http_client.dart (SimklHttpClient): New.
    Transport with app-key + bearer headers, typed 412/401 handling.

    case.
  * lib/core/database/dao/tv_show_dao.dart (TvShowDao.markEpisodesWatchedAt):

    per title instead of a commit per episode.
  * lib/core/import/import_progress.dart (ImportProgress, ImportStage,
    ImportProgressCallback): New. Moved out of core/services/import_service.dart
    (which re-exports them) so the import layer no longer depends on the
    collection-file importer.
  * lib/core/import/import_writer.dart (ImportWriteResult.itemIdsByKey,

- **Library statistics page — "my library in numbers" — in the personalization hub**

  The personalization hub (centre nav button) opens on a new statistics view,
  next to the genre cloud and recommendations. A dropdown across from the
  headline switches between all time and a calendar year. The hero shows the
  item total over a cover wall, library-wide consumption counters (episodes, chapters, pages, hours
  split into manual / tracker / runtime-estimated, average rating, replays,
  liked episodes), then the page breaks the library down block by block:
  per-media-type cards with a live status bar and completion percent, a
  month-by-month activity ribbon with each month's best-rated cover and a
  per-week drill-down dialog, best-vs-worst pairs per media type, game cards
  per platform (game count, hours, status split, most-played covers), anime
  and manga cards per source format (TV/OVA/Movie, manga/novel/one-shot) with
  top-rated covers, anime/manga subgenre chip cards side by side, "me vs the
  crowd" rating deltas, and a shareable PNG summary card. Everything is
  computed in SQL over the local timezone — no window functions, so it runs
  on old Android SQLite — and only the few dozen items that show covers are
  hydrated.

  The page has a phone layout of its own rather than a squeezed desktop one:
  wide and narrow build the same sections from the same models but out of
  separate files, so each can lay them out its own way. On a phone the hero
  metrics form a two-column grid instead of a ragged wrap, the activity ribbon
  loses its hover arrows and bleeds to the screen edges, gaps and card padding
  tighten, and the platform and format cards trade their cover strips for a
  second column. On desktop the page fills the window instead of a centred
  1240px column, and the section grids gain columns as the window grows
  instead of inflating their cards. Sections with no data are dropped outright
  rather than collapsing to zero height and leaving their gap behind.

  * lib/core/database/dao/stats_dao.dart (StatsDao): New. SQL aggregates:
    getTypeStatusCounts, getGamePlatformStatusCounts, getRewatchSum,
    getAverageRating, getEpisodeSplit, getProgressCounterSums,
    getLikedUnitsByType, getManualMinutes, getTrackerMinutes,
    getEstimatedMinutes, getAddedByMonth, getEpisodesByMonth,
    getBestItemByMonth, getGamePlatformRows, getTrackerMinutesByPlatform,
    getTopGamesByPlatform, getSourceFormatStatusCounts, getTopItemsByFormat,
    getSourceTagCounts, getRatedItemIds, getMonthAddedByDayType,
    getAvailableYears.
  * lib/features/statistics/models/library_stats.dart (LibraryStats,
    LibraryTotals, UnitsWatched, StatsHours, StatsPeriod, MonthActivity,
    MonthDetail, PlatformStats, FormatStats, TagCount, SubgenreGroup,
    VersusPair, RatingDelta): New pure-Dart payload models.
  * lib/features/statistics/providers/statistics_provider.dart
    (libraryStatsProvider, statsPeriodProvider, monthDetailProvider): New.
    Fetches the independent aggregates in parallel batches, then hydrates
    covers in one pass.
  * lib/features/statistics/screens/statistics_screen.dart (StatisticsScreen,
    _StatisticsScreenState._buildPage, _StatisticsScreenState._buildPeriodPicker):
    New. Owns the provider, the period picker and the PNG export, and picks the
    wide or the phone page by measured content width — a LayoutBuilder rather
    than MediaQuery, because the nav shell makes the window width overstate the
    room the sections get.
  * lib/features/statistics/views/statistics_view_desktop.dart
    (StatisticsViewDesktop), statistics_view_mobile.dart
    (StatisticsViewMobile), stats_sections.dart (statsSectionsAfterMonths):
    New. One file per form factor, sharing the section list that does not
    differ between them.
  * lib/features/statistics/layout/stats_layout.dart (StatsLayout),
    stats_layout_desktop.dart (kStatsLayoutDesktop), stats_layout_mobile.dart
    (kStatsLayoutMobile), stats_layout_scope.dart (StatsLayoutScope,
    kStatsMobileBreakpoint): New. The numbers a section cannot derive from its
    own constraints — gaps, card padding, grid column bounds, whether cards
    show their cover strip — with one file per form factor.
  * lib/features/statistics/widgets/stats_hero_common.dart (StatsHeroMetric,
    statsHeroMetrics, StatsHeroWall, StatsHeroMetricTile, StatsHoursBreakdown),
    stats_hero_desktop.dart (StatsHeroDesktop), stats_hero_mobile.dart
    (StatsHeroMobile), stats_months_common.dart (StatsMonthColumn,
    statsMonthsPeak, statsMonthRowHeight), stats_months_ribbon_desktop.dart
    (StatsMonthsRibbonDesktop), stats_months_ribbon_mobile.dart
    (StatsMonthsRibbonMobile): New, replacing stats_hero.dart and
    stats_months_ribbon.dart. The headline count sits in a FittedBox, so a
    narrow phone scales it down instead of ellipsizing it away.
  * lib/features/statistics/widgets/stats_period_picker.dart
    (StatsPeriodPicker, StatsPeriodPickerData): New. A dropdown in the hero
    across from the headline; a tab row cost a whole band of the page and grew
    with every year in the library.
  * lib/features/statistics/widgets/stats_types_section.dart
    (StatsTypesSection), stats_month_detail_dialog.dart
    (StatsMonthDetailDialog), stats_platforms_section.dart
    (StatsPlatformsSection), stats_formats_section.dart (StatsFormatsSection),
    stats_subgenres_section.dart (StatsSubgenresSection),
    stats_versus_section.dart (StatsVersusSection), stats_crowd_section.dart
    (StatsCrowdSection), stats_share_card.dart (StatsShareCard),
    stats_poster.dart (StatsPoster), stats_section_header.dart
    (StatsSectionHeader), stats_cards.dart (StatsCard, StatusSplitBar,
    StatsTopCoversRow, StatsLegendDot): New section widgets; the grid sections
    and the card shell take their column bounds and padding from StatsLayout.
  * lib/features/statistics/models/library_stats.dart
    (LibraryStats.hasTypeBreakdown, LibraryStats.hasMonthActivity,
    LibraryStats.hasCrowdDeltas, LibraryStats.hasFormats): New presence checks
    so the page can leave an empty section out instead of mounting one that
    collapses and still takes the gap after it.
  * lib/core/database/dao/collection_dao.dart
    (CollectionDao.getItemsWithDataByRowIds): New hydration of items by row
    ids, so aggregate screens load only what they show.
  * lib/core/database/database_service.dart (statsDaoProvider,
    DatabaseService.statsDao): Wire up the DAO.
  * lib/features/personalization/screens/personalization_screen.dart
    (PersonalizationScreen): Statistics becomes the hub's default view; the
    view switcher is a full-width FlatTabBar splitting the header into equal
    blocks, replacing a rounded pill that hugged its content and read as a
    fragment of an empty band.
  * lib/shared/widgets/flat_tab_bar.dart (FlatTabBar, FlatTabOption): New.
    Edge-to-edge switcher with no container of its own, for a page's own tab
    row — unlike SegmentedPill, which suits a toolbar beside other controls.
  * lib/shared/constants/media_type_ui.dart (MediaTypeUi.localizedPluralLabel):
    New plural type labels reused as section titles.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, app_ru.arb, app_zh.arb, app_es.arb, app_fr.arb,
    app_pt.arb: New stats* keys in every locale.

- **Kitsu anime run on the season-and-episode tracker, like TV series**

  A Kitsu anime opens the same season accordion TV shows use: episode tiles with
  a preview frame, title, air date, runtime and synopsis, a watched checkbox,
  likes and per-episode notes. Marking an episode moves the item to In progress,
  marking every episode completes it, and the card badge shows watched of total.
  Episodes without a preview frame borrow the season poster.

  Seasons come from Kitsu's own episode data, so long titles keep their real
  structure (Bleach: 16 seasons, 366 episodes) instead of one flat list.
  Episode numbering stays absolute the way anime is usually counted. AniList
  anime keep the flat counter — only Kitsu ships per-episode metadata.

  * lib/core/api/kitsu/kitsu_episode_api.dart (KitsuEpisodeApi.getAllEpisodes,
    KitsuEpisodeApi.getEpisodeCount): New. Kitsu caps a page at 20 episodes and
    has no season filter, so the full list is fetched — page one carries
    `meta.count` and the rest go out in parallel batches.
  * lib/core/api/kitsu_api.dart (KitsuApi.getAnimeEpisodes,
    KitsuApi.getAnimeEpisodeCount): Expose the episode API on the facade.
  * lib/core/api/episode_source/kitsu_episode_source.dart (KitsuEpisodeSource):
    New. Groups episodes into real seasons, falls back to a single synthesized
    season when the list is unavailable, and memoizes both the anime record and
    the episode list per show.
  * lib/core/api/episode_source/tv_episode_source.dart
    (tvEpisodeSourceResolverProvider): Route `DataSource.kitsu` to the new source.
  * lib/shared/models/tv_episode.dart (TvEpisode.tryFromKitsu): New factory;
    Kitsu's synopsis is plain text, so no HTML stripping.
  * lib/shared/models/collection_item.dart (CollectionItem.usesEpisodeTracker,
    CollectionItem.usesEpisodeTrackerFor): New single definition of "progress
    lives in the episode tracker", replacing the condition that was spelled out
    separately in the detail config and the card badge.
  * lib/shared/models/media_type.dart (MediaType.mayUseEpisodeTracker): New
    coarse check for callers that only know the type, such as cache invalidation.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/item_detail/item_detail_media_config.dart
    (ItemDetailMediaConfig.from): Kitsu anime get the tracker section instead of
    the flat progress widget.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/episode_tracker_section.dart
    (EpisodeTile.seasonPosterUrl): Stand-in image when an episode has no still
    of its own; cached under the season's id so it is not mistaken for the
    episode's own frame.
  * lib/features/collections/providers/episode_tracker_provider.dart
    (EpisodeTrackerNotifier._updateAutoStatus): Find the item through
    `usesEpisodeTracker` and read the episode total from the anime record, so
    status updates work without a cached show row.
  * lib/features/collections/helpers/tracker_card_progress.dart
    (trackerCardProgress): Same predicate, plus the anime episode count as the
    total.
  * lib/shared/utils/item_card_progress.dart (itemCardProgress): Kitsu anime
    fall through to the tracker badge instead of the item counter.
  * lib/core/services/export_service.dart (ExportService._attachWatchedEpisodes),
    lib/core/services/import_service.dart
    (ImportService._importWatchedEpisodes): Backups carry and restore watched
    episodes for Kitsu anime, which the tv-only gate skipped.
  * lib/core/database/dao/collection_dao.dart (CollectionDao._loadItemMeta,
    CollectionDao._transferWatchedEpisodes, CollectionDao._hasTvSibling): Moving
    a Kitsu anime between collections carries its marks; `_loadItemMeta` now
    selects `platform_id`, which the animated-series check needs.
  * lib/features/collections/providers/collections_provider.dart
    (CollectionItemsNotifier._invalidateEpisodeTrackers),
    lib/features/collections/helpers/bulk_operations.dart
    (BulkOperations._invalidateAfterMutation): Refresh live trackers after an
    anime move too.
  * test/helpers/fallbacks.dart (registerAllFallbacks): Register an `Anime`
    fallback for mocktail.

- **Branded loading indicator: the app logo pulses and rotates instead of the
  Material spinner**

  Long operations now show the Tonkatsu Box logo breathing (85%→105% scale)
  and turning a quarter revolution per pulse: the blocking overlay, import
  progress dialogs (Trakt, Kinorium, collections), Trakt archive validation,
  the genre cloud and recommendations loading states, and the All Items
  reload. Small inline spinners (collection pickers, image placeholders) keep
  the stock indicator.

  * lib/shared/widgets/logo_loader.dart (LogoLoader): New. Pure widget code —
    no dart:io or isolates — so the planned selfhost web target renders it
    unchanged.
  * lib/shared/widgets/loading_overlay.dart (withBlockingSpinner),
    lib/features/collections/widgets/import_progress_dialog.dart
    (ImportProgressDialog), lib/features/settings/content/trakt_import_content.dart,
    lib/features/settings/content/kinorium_import_content.dart,
    lib/features/genre_cloud/screens/genre_cloud_screen.dart,
    lib/features/genre_cloud/widgets/genre_cloud_view.dart,
    lib/features/recommendations/screens/recommendations_screen.dart,
    lib/features/home/screens/all_items_screen.dart: Replace the centred
    CircularProgressIndicator with LogoLoader.
  * test/shared/widgets/logo_loader_test.dart: New.

### Changed

- **Search asks what you are looking for, not which provider to ask**

  The first segment of the filter bar is now the media type, and every provider
  of that type answers at once: a manga search reaches AniList, MangaDex,
  MangaBaka and Kitsu in one go instead of one at a time. Providers are listed
  underneath and can be switched off individually; with several answering, the
  results are laid out one block per provider, and "all →" narrows to a single
  one, where the flat grid, its paging and sorting take over. A failing
  provider now reports its own error inline while the others keep their
  results, instead of blanking the screen. Each provider also shows its own
  progress: AniList answers instantly and Kitsu takes seconds, so the slow one
  holds a shimmering block (and a spinner on its chip) until it lands, rather
  than looking like a provider that found nothing.

  Filters that mean the same thing in several providers — status and format —
  are merged into one control, so "Publishing" is picked once and each provider
  receives its own spelling of it (`RELEASING`, `ongoing`, `releasing`,
  `current`). A provider that has no word for the picked value drops out of the
  query and says so on its chip rather than silently returning nothing.
  Provider-specific filters (genres, tags, year, content rating, demographic)
  stay theirs and live in the filter sheet, grouped under the provider's logo.

  * lib/features/search/models/common_filter.dart (CommonFilter,
    CommonFilterOptions, CommonFilterMember, CommonFilterTarget,
    MediaTypeFilters, filtersForMediaType): New. Joins filters by
    [FilterSemantic] and keeps a family shared only when two or more providers
    know it — one provider's filter stays its own, so it never loses its owner.
  * lib/features/search/models/search_source.dart (FilterSemantic,
    FilterSemanticFamily, FilterOption.semantic, SearchFilter.semanticFamily):
    New. Cross-provider identity of an option, since ids and labels diverge.
  * lib/features/search/filters/anilist_anime_format_filter.dart
    (AniListAnimeFormatFilter), anilist_anime_status_filter.dart
    (AniListAnimeStatusFilter), anilist_manga_status_filter.dart
    (AniListMangaStatusFilter), kitsu_anime_status_filter.dart
    (KitsuAnimeStatusFilter), kitsu_anime_subtype_filter.dart
    (KitsuAnimeSubtypeFilter), kitsu_manga_status_filter.dart
    (KitsuMangaStatusFilter), kitsu_manga_subtype_filter.dart
    (KitsuMangaSubtypeFilter), manga_format_filter.dart (MangaFormatFilter),
    mangabaka_status_filter.dart (MangaBakaStatusFilter),
    mangabaka_type_filter.dart (MangaBakaTypeFilter),
    mangadex_status_filter.dart (MangaDexStatusFilter): Declare a semantic
    family and tag each option with its semantic. Raw API values untouched.
  * lib/features/search/providers/browse_provider.dart (BrowseState,
    BrowseNotifier, CommonSelection, BrowseSettingsKeys): Hold a media type and
    a per-provider slice of results, filter values, pages and errors instead of
    one active source. `BrowseState.loadingSourceIds` /
    `BrowseState.isSourceLoading` replace the single `isLoading` flag, which
    `isLoading` now derives from — one flag could not say which provider is
    still answering. Per-provider request signatures mean hiding a provider
    and bringing it back costs no requests. Sort belongs to the provider it was
    picked for, so it cannot leak into another's request. A saved pre-0.41
    source id is migrated to that source's media type.
  * lib/features/search/sources/search_sources.dart (searchSourcesByMediaType,
    searchableMediaTypes, searchSourcesFor, primarySearchSourceFor): New.
    Providers grouped by output media type, registration order preserved.
  * lib/features/search/widgets/filter_bar.dart (FilterBar, _SheetButton,
    _SortChevron), filter_bar_compact.dart (CompactFilterBar),
    media_type_chevron.dart (MediaTypeChevron), filter_control.dart
    (FilterOptionsLoader, FilterChevron, FilterPick), filter_sheet.dart
    (FilterSheet): Media type first, shared filters in the bar, per-provider
    filters and the provider switches in the sheet.
  * lib/features/search/widgets/browse_sections.dart (BrowseSections),
    browse_sections_compact.dart (BrowseSectionsCompact), browse_card.dart
    (BrowseCard, CollectedIds, collectedIdsProvider, extractTitle,
    buildPlatformLabel), source_chips_row.dart (SourceChipsRow),
    source_error_strip.dart (SourceErrorStrip): New. Per-provider result
    blocks, provider chips and the inline per-provider error.
  * lib/features/search/widgets/browse_grid.dart (BrowseGrid): Keeps the flat
    grid for a single answering provider; card branches moved to BrowseCard.
    The viewport-fill check also runs on first build — narrowing hands the grid
    a page already in state, and a page too short to scroll on a tall window
    could otherwise never ask for the next one.
  * lib/features/search/providers/discover_provider.dart
    (discoverSectionsPerMediaType, discoverMediaTypes),
    lib/features/search/widgets/discover_feed.dart (DiscoverFeed.mediaType),
    lib/features/search/widgets/discover_customize_sheet.dart
    (DiscoverCustomizeSheet.mediaType): Key the TMDB feeds by media type.
  * lib/shared/navigation/search_providers.dart (SearchTabRequest.mediaType),
    lib/shared/navigation/app_shell.dart (_AppShellState),
    lib/features/wishlist/screens/wishlist_screen.dart
    (wishlistMediaTypeFor): A wishlist note opens the Search tab on its media
    type with every provider on, replacing the hand-written hint-to-source map.
  * lib/shared/theme/app_typography.dart (AppTypography.posterSourceLogoScale,
    AppTypography.posterTextBlockHeight),
    lib/shared/widgets/media_poster_card.dart
    (_MediaPosterCardState._buildTitleBlock,
    _MediaPosterCardState._buildMetaText): Budget the subtitle row for the
    source logo, and pin the title and meta line heights with
    `forceStrutHeight` — the rating star and CJK titles come from fallback
    fonts whose taller lines burst the block budgeted as fontSize×height.
  * lib/l10n/app_*.arb: searchWhatToFind, searchSourcesLabel,
    searchCommonFilters, searchShowAll, searchSourceNoResponse,
    searchSourceLacksValue, searchNarrowedBySource, searchTextOnlyHint,
    searchSortNeedsSingleSource, searchSortUnavailableInSearch.

- **Rainbow highlight on the centre navigation button**

  The centre button opens the whole library — statistics, genre cloud and
  recommendations — but its highlight was the same flat orange as every other
  tab, so it did not read as different. It now fills with the media-type
  accents run around the circle.

  * lib/shared/constants/media_type_theme.dart (MediaTypeTheme.rainbowSweep):
    New. Every accent sorted by hue with the first repeated at the end, since
    a SweepGradient meets a hard seam otherwise. Sorted rather than written
    out by hand so a new media type places itself.
  * lib/shared/navigation/liquid_indicator.dart (LiquidIndicator.rainbow,
    _LiquidIndicatorState.build): Paint the sweep instead of the flat brand
    fill, cross-faded over the same slide so the colour does not snap halfway
    between the centre button and a tab. Russian comments translated.
  * lib/shared/navigation/app_sidebar.dart (AppSidebar),
    lib/shared/navigation/app_bottom_bar.dart (AppBottomBar): Turn the rainbow
    on while the centre button is the active destination.
  * test/shared/constants/media_type_theme_test.dart: Sweep closes the loop,
    covers every media type, and runs in hue order.

- **Genre cloud legends fit on one scrolling row**

  The facet and media-type legends wrapped, so on a phone every extra media
  type stole another line from the cloud itself. They are one fixed-height row
  each now, scrolled by swipe on mobile and by the usual hover arrows, wheel
  or click-drag on desktop, and they run to the screen edges.

  * lib/features/genre_cloud/screens/genre_cloud_screen.dart (_ChipRow,
    _ChipRowState): Wrap replaced by ScrollableRowWithArrows, matching the
    collection chips and subfilter rows. The page inset moved into the scroll
    view's content padding so the chips scroll out to the edges.
  * test/features/genre_cloud/genre_cloud_screen_test.dart: The cloud's top
    edge does not move as media types are added.

- **Move DAO query infrastructure and pure-Dart utils into the `core` package**

  Second wave of the selfhost-web extraction (after the migrations): the
  chunked-query and sparse-upsert helpers every DAO uses, the SQLite health
  checks, and the six dependency-free utils the models rely on now live in
  `packages/core`, ready for the selfhost server. No behaviour change — files
  moved verbatim, only import paths in the app were updated.

  * packages/core/lib/database/query_chunk.dart (queryByIdsInChunks),
    packages/core/lib/database/sparse_upsert.dart,
    packages/core/lib/database/sqlite_health.dart (readUserVersion,
    quickCheckOk): Moved from lib/core/database/.
  * packages/core/lib/utils/anime_manga_title_language.dart,
    packages/core/lib/utils/bbcode.dart, packages/core/lib/utils/html_text.dart,
    packages/core/lib/utils/kitsu_status.dart,
    packages/core/lib/utils/stable_id.dart,
    packages/core/lib/utils/tvmaze_json.dart: Moved from lib/shared/utils/.
  * lib/, test/: Import paths rewritten to `package:core/...` across the DAOs,
    models, services and tests that consume the moved files.

- **Loading indicators no longer freeze during heavy operations**

  The spinner used to stand still because heavy work ran synchronously on the
  UI thread. The genre cloud layout now computes cooperatively (yielding to
  the event loop on a time budget, so it also works on the future web target),
  and the Trakt / Kinorium imports unzip and parse their exports on a
  background isolate. Animations keep running through personalization loads
  and import parsing.

  * lib/features/genre_cloud/genre_cloud_layout.dart (layoutGenreCloudAsync,
    _placeAllChunked, _placeWord): New chunked layout entry point producing
    results identical to the synchronous layoutGenreCloud (kept for export
    views).
  * lib/features/genre_cloud/widgets/genre_cloud_view.dart
    (_GenreCloudViewState._runLayout, _GenreCloudViewState._memoizedMeasure,
    measureGenreWord): Drive the deferred layout through the async entry
    point; memoize word measurements across auto-fit and growth passes and
    dispose TextPainters after measuring.
  * lib/core/import/sources/trakt/trakt_import_service.dart
    (TraktImportService.validateZip, TraktImportService._readAndParseArchive,
    _TraktParsedArchive): Read, unzip and JSON-parse the export via
    Isolate.run; parse helpers became static so the isolate closure carries no
    API/DB handles.
  * lib/core/import/sources/kinorium/kinorium_import_service.dart
    (KinoriumImportService.import): Read and parse the CSV via Isolate.run.
  * test/features/genre_cloud/genre_cloud_layout_test.dart: Async layout
    equivalence tests.

- **Poster cards show the title under the artwork instead of over it**

  Grid and carousel cards no longer cover the bottom of the poster with a
  translucent title banner. The artwork stays clear, and the title plus its
  meta line (rating, platform, year, type, genre) sit below it in a block of
  fixed height, so cards in a row stay aligned however long the titles are and
  a one-line title keeps its meta line right underneath. What stays on the
  poster is a thin strip carrying the status and tag on the left and the
  episode count on the right — and it disappears entirely for items that have
  none of them. Hovering no longer expands the title; the full name comes up as
  a tooltip. Loading skeletons now reserve the same title block, so posters do
  not jump when the real cards arrive.

  * lib/shared/widgets/media_poster_card.dart
    (_MediaPosterCardState._buildGridVariant,
    _MediaPosterCardState._buildTitleBlock,
    _MediaPosterCardState._buildGridPoster,
    _MediaPosterCardState._buildStatsStrip,
    _MediaPosterCardState._buildSubtitleRow): Title and subtitle moved out of
    the poster into a fixed-height block with a hover-only tooltip (the default
    long-press trigger would take the card's context menu on Android); the
    former bottom banner is now a stats strip that puts the status and tag left
    and the progress label right, and collapses when the item has none of them.
  * lib/features/settings/screens/card_banner_debug_screen.dart
    (CardBannerDebugScreen, _StatsStripBanner, _StatusStripeBanner,
    _SplitMetaBanner, _MetaLine, _EpisodeCount): Laboratory keeps only the
    three variants still in play (D, F, G), each showing the source logo and
    the episode count on the right; the gradient, solid, frosted, inline-slash
    and progress-label mockups are gone.
  * lib/shared/theme/app_typography.dart (AppTypography.posterTitleFor,
    AppTypography.posterSubtitleFor, AppTypography.posterTextBlockHeight): New.
    Poster text styles per card variant, plus the height of two title lines and
    one subtitle line derived from those styles and the system font scale.
  * lib/shared/theme/app_spacing.dart (AppSpacing.posterCardAspectRatio,
    AppSpacing.posterRowVerticalPadding, AppSpacing.cardTitleBlockGap,
    AppSpacing.cardTitleBlockHeight, AppSpacing.posterRowHeight): New. One
    source of truth for the grid cell ratio and the carousel row height.
  * lib/shared/widgets/shimmer_loading.dart (ShimmerPosterCard,
    ShimmerPosterGrid): Skeleton card reserves the same title block and gained
    a compact variant; the grid skeleton takes its ratio from AppSpacing.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_items_view.dart
    (CollectionItemsView), lib/features/home/screens/all_items_screen.dart
    (_AllItemsScreenState), lib/features/search/widgets/browse_grid.dart
    (_BrowseGridState): Grid cells use AppSpacing.posterCardAspectRatio.
  * lib/shared/widgets/book_carousel.dart (BookCarousel, BookCarouselShimmer),
    lib/features/search/widgets/discover_row.dart (DiscoverRow),
    lib/features/search/widgets/discover_feed.dart (DiscoverFeed),
    lib/features/collections/widgets/recommendations_section.dart
    (_RecommendationRow, _RecommendationShimmer),
    lib/features/collections/widgets/manga_similars_section.dart (_MangaRow,
    _MangaRowShimmer), lib/features/recommendations/widgets/recommendation_row.dart
    (RecommendationRowWidget): Row height via AppSpacing.posterRowHeight, and
    the loading rows reuse ShimmerPosterCard instead of four hand-rolled
    copies of the same placeholder.
  * test/shared/theme/app_typography_test.dart: New.
    test/shared/theme/app_spacing_test.dart,
    test/shared/widgets/media_poster_card_test.dart,
    test/shared/widgets/shimmer_loading_test.dart: Title-block metrics, layout
    of the title and meta line, and a render check at double font scale.

### Fixed

- **Episode watch marks no longer stay behind for a look-alike sibling**

  Moving a series between collections deletes its old watch marks unless
  another item can still use them. The sibling check now counts only items
  that actually carry marks — an animated movie sharing the same TMDB id
  (movie and TV ids overlap numerically) no longer keeps orphaned rows alive.

  * packages/core/lib/database/dao/collection_dao.dart (CollectionDao._hasTvSibling):
    Mirror CollectionItem.usesEpisodeTrackerFor — require platform_id for
    animation and source kitsu for anime instead of any media-type match.
  * packages/core/test/database/dao/collection_dao_watched_transfer_test.dart:
    Regression test with an animated-movie and an AniList-anime sibling.

- **Backup restore keeps collection creation and item added dates**

  Restoring a full backup used to stamp every collection and item with the
  restore day, collapsing the whole "added by month" history. The exported
  dates now survive the round trip (user-data exports only).

  * lib/core/services/import_service.dart (ImportService): Pass the exported
    collection `created` date and per-item added date through the restore.
  * lib/core/database/dao/collection_dao.dart
    (CollectionDao.createCollection, CollectionDao.addItemToCollection):
    Optional createdAt / addedAt overrides, defaulting to now.
  * lib/core/database/database_service.dart (DatabaseService.createCollection,
    DatabaseService.addItemToCollection), lib/data/repositories/collection_repository.dart
    (CollectionRepository.create, CollectionRepository.addItemToCollection):
    Plumb the new parameters through.
  * test/core/services/import_service_test.dart: Restore-date regression tests.

- **Tier list card labels no longer overflow under Android font scaling**

  The compact card label reserves exactly two lines of caption text; with a
  system font scale above 1.0 the text grew past that and threw a RenderFlex
  overflow. The tiny caption now opts out of system text scaling — the full
  name stays available in the tooltip.

  * lib/features/tier_lists/widgets/tier_item_card.dart (TierItemCard._buildCard):
    Pin the label to TextScaler.noScaling and drop the single-child Column
    that produced the overflowing RenderFlex.
  * test/features/tier_lists/widgets/tier_item_card_test.dart: Regression test
    at text scale 1.3.

## [0.40.0] - 2026-07-26

### Added

- **Favourites filter inside a collection**

  The chevron bar in a collection gains a Favorite segment. It combines with
  the type, subfilter, tag, status and search filters, and the type counts
  follow it.

  * lib/features/collections/helpers/collection_filters.dart
    (CollectionFilters.favoriteOnly): New filter field, applied alongside the
    others so grid, table and counts share one definition.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_filter_bar.dart
    (CollectionFilterBar.filterFavoriteOnly,
    CollectionFilterBar.onFavoriteToggled): New segment after the status
    dropdown, tinted with the favourite accent.
  * lib/features/collections/screens/collection_screen.dart
    (_CollectionScreenState._filterFavoriteOnly): Holds the toggle, like the
    collection's other filters it resets when the screen is reopened.

- **A light `.xcoll` restores items from every source, not just TMDB and AniList**

  Importing a light file refetches each item from the provider it came from,
  including TVmaze shows, Kitsu and MangaDex titles, and books.

  Light exports also carry `native_id` for books and MangaDex manga. Files
  exported by earlier versions don't have it: their books and MangaDex manga
  arrive unresolved and can be fixed with a refresh of the item.

  * lib/core/services/import_service.dart (ImportService._fetchMediaFromApi,
    ImportService._fetchTvShow, ImportService._fetchMangaRefs,
    ImportService._fetchOneManga, ImportService._fetchAnimeRefs,
    ImportService._fetchOneAnime, ImportService._fetchBookRefs,
    ImportService._fetchOneBook, _MediaRef): Group items by
    `(media type, source)` and route each group to its own API; AniList still
    resolves its ids in one batched query. A provider that fails or is not
    wired only drops its own items.
  * lib/shared/models/collection_item.dart (CollectionItem.exportNativeId,
    CollectionItem.toExport): Carry `native_id` for books and MangaDex manga.
  * lib/shared/models/manga.dart (Manga.mangaDexUuid): Recover the UUID from
    the cached `externalUrl`; collection_actions.dart uses it too instead of
    splitting the URL itself.
  * docs/RCOLL_FORMAT.md: Document `native_id` and the per-source hydration.

- **Tag several selected items at once**

  The selection toolbar in a collection and on All Items gains add-tags and
  remove-tags actions. Both open the same tag picker used for a single item,
  with nothing pre-checked: a checked box means "apply to all of them", not
  "this item has it". Adding is additive and removing only drops the tags you
  picked, so per-item tags and their manual order survive either way.

  On a narrow window the toolbar stacks: the counter keeps its own line and
  the actions get theirs.

  * lib/core/database/dao/global_tag_dao.dart (GlobalTagDao.addTagsToItems,
    GlobalTagDao.removeTagsFromItems): New batched link writes over an item
    list and a tag set — one `INSERT OR IGNORE` batch and one chunked
    `DELETE`.
  * lib/features/collections/providers/item_tags_provider.dart
    (ItemTagsNotifier.addTagsToItems, ItemTagsNotifier.removeTagsFromItems,
    ItemTagsNotifier._syncItems): Bulk map updates — one write plus one
    read-back that keeps the in-memory tag order identical to the DAO's, then
    a single state update. Return how many links changed.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/bulk_action_bar.dart (BulkActionBar,
    BulkActionBar._handleTags, BulkActionBar._buildSelectionControls,
    BulkActionBar._buildActionStrip): Add the two tag actions; split the bar
    into a selection-controls row and an action strip laid out in one or two
    rows by width; ellipsize the counter so it can't push Select all off the
    edge.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/tag_picker_dialog.dart (TagPickerDialog):
    Accept an optional title and confirm label so a bulk caller can say what
    the picked tags will do.
  * lib/l10n/app_*.arb (bulkAddTags, bulkRemoveTags, bulkAddTagsTitle,
    bulkRemoveTagsTitle, bulkTagsAdded, bulkTagsRemoved, bulkTagsUnchanged):
    New keys.

- **French (fr) interface localization**

  The app interface is now available in French alongside English, Russian,
  Simplified Chinese, Spanish and Brazilian Portuguese. The language and
  welcome pickers offer Français, and selecting it defaults TMDB content
  language to `fr-FR`. Contributed by @GreenStatik (#384).

  * lib/l10n/app_fr.arb, lib/l10n/app_localizations_fr.dart (SFr): New —
    full fr translation (all 1517 keys) and its generated delegate.
  * lib/l10n/app_localizations.dart (S.supportedLocales,
    _SDelegate.isSupported, lookupS): Register the `fr` locale.
  * lib/features/settings/screens/settings_screen.dart (_kAppLanguageNames):
    Add Français to the app-language picker.
  * lib/features/welcome/widgets/welcome_step_language.dart
    (WelcomeStepLanguage): Add the option and reindex the WelcomeReveal
    steps after it.
  * lib/shared/constants/tmdb_content_languages.dart
    (_kUiToContentLanguage): Map `fr` → `fr-FR`.
  * README.md, docs/index.html (feat_lang_title, feat_lang_desc),
    fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/full_description.txt: List French among
    the interface languages.

- **TVmaze as a TV series source**

  A keyless alternative source for TV series, like TMDB. Search shows by
  title, track their seasons and episodes, and follow upcoming episodes in
  the release calendar. Title search only, and TV only — no films.

  TV posters are now cached per source, like anime and manga covers. Posters
  saved under the old key download again the first time their card is shown.
  Animated series and films are untouched.

  * lib/core/api/tvmaze_api.dart (TvMazeApi, tvMazeApiProvider),
    lib/core/api/tvmaze/ (TvMazeHttpClient, TvMazeShowApi,
    TvMazeApiException): New TVmaze REST client.
  * lib/core/api/episode_source/tvmaze_episode_source.dart
    (TvMazeEpisodeSource), tv_episode_source.dart
    (tvEpisodeSourceResolverProvider): New season / episode source, routed
    by DataSource.
  * lib/shared/models/tv_show.dart (TvShow.fromTvMaze),
    lib/shared/models/tv_season.dart (TvSeason.fromTvMaze),
    lib/shared/models/tv_episode.dart (TvEpisode.tryFromTvMaze): New source
    factories.
  * lib/shared/models/data_source.dart (DataSource.tvmaze),
    lib/shared/theme/app_assets.dart (AppAssets.iconTvMazeColor),
    assets/images/icon_twm_color.png: New source and brand logo.
  * lib/shared/utils/html_text.dart (stripHtmlText),
    lib/shared/utils/tvmaze_json.dart (tvMazeImageUrl, tvMazeRating): New
    shared mapping helpers.
  * lib/features/search/sources/tvmaze_tv_source.dart (TvMazeTvSource),
    search_sources.dart (searchSources): New title-search source, registered.
  * lib/features/collections/helpers/collection_actions.dart
    (_refreshItemWork): Route TV show refresh through the item's own episode
    source instead of always TMDB.
  * lib/shared/utils/cover_image_id.dart (coverImageId): Namespace
    `MediaType.tvShow` covers by source; animation stays bare.
  * lib/shared/models/canvas_item.dart (CanvasItem.mediaCacheId),
    lib/features/search/handlers/tv_show_handler.dart,
    lib/features/search/widgets/browse_grid.dart, item_details_sheet.dart,
    discover_row.dart, lib/features/collections/widgets/
    recommendations_section.dart, lib/features/recommendations/widgets/
    recommendation_row.dart: Build the cache id through `coverImageId` instead
    of the bare TMDB id.
  * lib/shared/constants/source_catalog.dart (kDataSourceCatalog),
    lib/features/welcome/widgets/welcome_step_sources.dart,
    lib/features/settings/content/credits_content.dart: Catalog, onboarding
    and credits entries.
  * lib/l10n/app_*.arb (welcomeSourceDescTvMaze, creditsTvMazeAttribution):
    New keys.
  * README.md, docs/index.html,
    fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/full_description.txt: List TVmaze among
    the data sources.

- **"Similar manga" recommendations on MangaBaka and MangaDex cards**

  A horizontal row of similar titles on a manga's detail card, shown when the
  item comes from MangaBaka or MangaDex. Tapping a card opens its details
  sheet and can add it to a collection.

  * lib/core/api/mangabaka/mangabaka_manga_api.dart
    (MangaBakaMangaApi.getRecommendations), lib/core/api/mangabaka_api.dart
    (MangaBakaApi.getRecommendations): New `/series/mix` call, reusing
    Manga.fromMangaBaka to parse each result's embedded series.
  * lib/core/api/mangadex/mangadex_manga_api.dart
    (MangaDexMangaApi.getRecommendations), lib/core/api/mangadex_api.dart
    (MangaDexApi.getRecommendations): New `/manga/{id}/recommendation` call;
    the top matches are hydrated with covers in one batched `/manga?ids[]`
    call and returned in score order.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/manga_similars_section.dart
    (MangaSimilarsSection): New section widget; a per-seed cached
    FutureProvider routes by `Manga.source` and handles the owned badge.
  * lib/features/collections/screens/item_detail_screen.dart
    (_ItemDetailScreenState._addMangaFromSimilars): Mount the section for
    MangaBaka and MangaDex manga and add a tapped result to a chosen
    collection.

- **MangaDex and Kitsu as manga search sources**

  Two more keyless manga providers alongside AniList and MangaBaka. Both
  search by title, map covers, ratings, year, status and chapter/volume
  counts, and carry their own `DataSource`. MangaDex adds Genre, Tags,
  status, demographic, content-rating and sort filters; Kitsu adds subtype,
  status and sort, and shows its wide cover art as the card backdrop.

  * lib/core/api/mangadex_api.dart (MangaDexApi), lib/core/api/mangadex/
    (MangaDexHttpClient, MangaDexMangaApi, MangaDexTagsApi,
    MangaDexApiException): New MangaDex REST client.
  * lib/core/api/kitsu_api.dart (KitsuApi), lib/core/api/kitsu/
    (KitsuHttpClient, KitsuMangaApi, KitsuAnimeApi, KitsuApiException): New
    Kitsu JSON:API client; KitsuHttpClient.totalCount / KitsuHttpClient.hasNext
    hold the shared pagination parsing.
  * lib/shared/models/manga.dart (Manga.fromMangaDex, Manga.fromKitsu),
    lib/shared/models/anime.dart (Anime.fromKitsu): New source factories.
  * lib/shared/models/mangadex_tag.dart (MangaDexTag): New tag model.
  * lib/shared/utils/stable_id.dart (fnv1a64): Lifted out of
    lib/shared/models/book.dart so MangaDex can fold its UUID into the
    numeric external-id contract; book.dart re-exports it.
  * lib/shared/utils/kitsu_status.dart (kitsuStatusVocab): Shared Kitsu
    status → vocabulary mapping used by both models.
  * lib/shared/models/data_source.dart (DataSource.mangadex, DataSource.kitsu),
    lib/shared/theme/app_assets.dart (AppAssets.iconMangaDexColor,
    AppAssets.iconKitsuColor): New sources and brand logos.
  * lib/features/search/sources/mangadex_source.dart (MangaDexSource),
    kitsu_manga_source.dart (KitsuMangaSource),
    search_sources.dart (searchSources): New sources, registered.
  * lib/features/search/filters/mangadex_genre_filter.dart,
    mangadex_tag_filter.dart, mangadex_status_filter.dart,
    mangadex_demographic_filter.dart, mangadex_content_rating_filter.dart,
    kitsu_manga_subtype_filter.dart, kitsu_manga_status_filter.dart: New
    filters.
  * lib/features/search/widgets/mangadex_tag_picker.dart
    (showMangaDexTagPicker): New MangaBaka-style tag picker.
  * lib/data/repositories/mangadex_tags_repository.dart
    (MangaDexTagsRepository), lib/core/database/dao/mangadex_tag_dao.dart
    (MangaDexTagDao): SQLite-cached tag catalog.
  * packages/core/lib/database/migrations/migration_v59.dart (MigrationV59): New
    `mangadex_tags` table; registered in migration_registry.dart and
    database_service.dart (version 59, MangaDexTagDao wiring).
  * lib/features/collections/helpers/collection_actions.dart
    (_refreshItemWork): Route manga refresh to the new APIs by source
    (MangaDex recovers its UUID from the cached externalUrl).
  * lib/shared/constants/source_catalog.dart (kDataSourceCatalog): Catalog
    entries.
  * lib/features/settings/content/credits_content.dart,
    lib/features/welcome/widgets/welcome_step_sources.dart: Credits and
    onboarding entries.
  * lib/l10n/app_*.arb (welcomeSourceDescMangaDex, welcomeSourceDescKitsu,
    creditsMangaDexAttribution, creditsKitsuAttribution,
    browseFilterDemographic): New keys.
  * README.md, docs/index.html,
    fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/full_description.txt: List MangaDex and
    Kitsu among the data sources.

- **Custom card form: personal note and tags**

  The create form gained "My Notes" and "Tags" fields (tags as
  comma-separated input). Loading a JSON/CSV file prefills them from the
  `comment` and `tags` columns. On Create the note is saved as the item's
  personal comment and the tags go through the global tag system, creating
  missing tags automatically. The edit form does not show the fields.

  * lib/features/collections/widgets/custom_item/custom_item_data.dart
    (CustomItemData.comment, CustomItemData.tags): New fields.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/create_custom_item_dialog.dart
    (_CreateCustomItemDialogState._buildCommentSection,
    _CreateCustomItemDialogState._buildTagsSection,
    _CreateCustomItemDialogState._applyEntry): Fields, prefill, submit.
  * lib/shared/models/tag.dart (Tag.dedupeNames): New shared tag-name
    parser, reused by lib/core/import/sources/custom_file/custom_cards_parser.dart
    (CustomCardsParser._tags) and the form.
  * lib/features/collections/providers/collections_provider.dart
    (CollectionItemsNotifier.addCustomItem,
    CollectionItemsNotifier._applyItemTags): Write the comment and tags
    onto the created item.
  * lib/features/collections/screens/collection_screen.dart
    (_handleCreateCustomItem): Pass the new fields through.
  * lib/l10n/app_*.arb (customItemMyNoteHint, customItemTagsHint): New
    hints.

- **Text export: `{link}` token**

  The template exporter can now output the item's external page URL —
  IGDB for games, TMDB for movies and shows, AniList for anime and manga,
  the user's own link for custom items. An empty link is stripped together
  with its separator like the other tokens.

  * lib/shared/models/collection_item.dart (CollectionItem.externalUrl):
    New getter resolving the active media's URL.
  * lib/core/services/text_export_service.dart
    (TextExportService.availableTokens, TextExportService.formatItem):
    Register and fill the token.

- **Mood grid: separate tap zones, auto-filled cell labels, sticky picker,
  cleaner export, cell size control**

  Tapping the cover picks an item while tapping the label below edits the
  text (right-click menu unchanged). A new per-grid "Cell labels" template
  (same tokens as row captions) fills an empty label automatically when an
  item is picked. The item picker remembers its collection filter and
  search text while the grid stays open, reuses the loaded item list,
  hides duplicates of the same title held in several collections, and
  builds its grid in windows of 60 cards as the user scrolls.
  Exported PNGs no longer draw the `+` placeholder for empty slots. A size
  stepper (80–240) scales cells on screen and in the export; the value is
  session-only and resets to the default on reopen. On desktop the grid
  shows draggable scrollbars for both axes and pans with a mouse drag. On
  narrow screens the stepper toolbar reflows into two rows of equal-width
  controls.

  * packages/core/lib/database/migrations/migration_v58.dart (MigrationV58): New —
    `cell_label_template` column on `mood_grids`.
  * lib/features/mood_grids/services/mood_grid_caption.dart
    (kMoodGridCaptionTokens, renderRowCaption): New shared template renderer
    used by row captions and the auto-filled cell labels.
  * packages/core/lib/database/migrations/migration_registry.dart
    (MigrationRegistry.all), lib/core/database/database_service.dart:
    Register v58, bump version to 58.
  * lib/shared/models/mood_grid.dart (MoodGrid.cellLabelTemplate): New
    field in fromDb/toDb/fromExport/toExport/copyWith.
  * lib/core/database/dao/mood_grid_dao.dart
    (MoodGridDao.setCellLabelTemplate): New setter.
  * lib/features/mood_grids/providers/mood_grid_detail_provider.dart
    (MoodGridDetailNotifier.setCellItem,
    MoodGridDetailNotifier._autoFillLabel,
    MoodGridDetailNotifier.setCellLabelTemplate): Auto-fill only on item
    pick and only into an empty label.
  * lib/features/mood_grids/providers/mood_grid_picker_session_provider.dart
    (MoodGridPickerSession, MoodGridPickerSessionNotifier): New — filter,
    query and per-filter item cache pinned to the grid screen's lifetime;
    the cache collapses duplicates by media identity.
  * lib/features/mood_grids/widgets/mood_grid_cell_widget.dart
    (MoodGridCellWidget.onLabelTap): Split tap targets; label renders up
    to two lines without clipping glyphs.
  * lib/features/mood_grids/widgets/mood_grid_item_picker.dart
    (_MoodGridItemPickerState): Read/write the session instead of local
    state; incremental 60-card grid windows; card tile leaves room for a
    two-line title.
  * lib/features/mood_grids/widgets/mood_grid_export_view.dart
    (MoodGridExportView._buildCell, MoodGridExportView.cellWidth): Blank
    empty slots; cell width as a parameter.
  * lib/features/mood_grids/widgets/mood_grid_view.dart (_MoodGridViewState):
    Interactive scrollbars on both axes, mouse-drag panning.
  * lib/features/mood_grids/screens/mood_grid_detail_screen.dart
    (_MoodGridDetailScreenState._buildResizeControls,
    _MoodGridDetailScreenState._editCellLabelTemplate): Size stepper,
    template dialog reused for both templates, dialog controllers
    disposed.
  * lib/l10n/app_*.arb (moodGridCellLabelTemplate, moodGridCellSize): New
    keys.

- **Brazilian Portuguese (pt) interface localization**

  The app interface is now available in Brazilian Portuguese alongside
  English, Russian, Simplified Chinese and Spanish. The language and
  welcome pickers offer Português (Brasil), and selecting it defaults
  TMDB content language to `pt-BR`. Contributed by @bonbj (#370).

  * lib/l10n/app_pt.arb, lib/l10n/app_localizations_pt.dart (SPt): New —
    full pt translation (all 1517 keys) and its generated delegate.
  * lib/l10n/app_localizations.dart (S.supportedLocales,
    _SDelegate.isSupported, lookupS): Register the `pt` locale.
  * lib/features/settings/screens/settings_screen.dart: Add Português
    (Brasil) to the app-language picker.
  * lib/features/welcome/widgets/welcome_step_language.dart
    (_WelcomeStepLanguageState, _LanguageOption): Add the option; reindex
    WelcomeReveal; ellipsize long labels.
  * lib/shared/constants/tmdb_content_languages.dart: Map `pt` → `pt-BR`.

- **Full export (.xcollx) with user data now carries watched-episode marks
  and restores them on import**

  Watch marks travel in a new per-item `_watched_episodes` section and are
  re-applied to the target collection on import. Older files without the
  section import as before; the format version stays 3.

  * lib/core/services/export_service.dart
    (ExportService._attachWatchedEpisodes): Nest the item's watch marks
    under `_watched_episodes` (full export, user data only).
  * lib/core/services/import_service.dart
    (ImportService._importWatchedEpisodes): Restore the marks re-scoped
    to the target collection; conflict-ignoring, so re-import merges.
  * docs/RCOLL_FORMAT.md: Document the `_watched_episodes` item field.

- **Kitsu as an anime search source**

  Kitsu joins AniList as a keyless anime source, searchable by title with
  subtype, status and sort filters. Anime identity is now `(id, source)`: an
  AniList and a Kitsu title sharing a numeric id coexist in the cache,
  collections, mood grids and canvas, and covers are namespaced by provider.

  * packages/core/lib/database/migrations/migration_v60.dart (MigrationV60): Rebuild
    `anime_cache` with a composite `(id, source)` primary key, rename the old
    source-material column to `source_material`, and add source-aware
    `collection_items` anime indexes; registered in migration_registry.dart
    and database_service.dart (version 60).
  * lib/shared/models/anime.dart (Anime.source, Anime.sourceMaterial,
    Anime.fromKitsu, Anime.fromDb, Anime.toDb, Anime.copyWith): Add the
    provider `source` field; the former source-material `source` becomes
    `sourceMaterial`.
  * lib/core/database/dao/anime_dao.dart (AnimeDao.getAnime): Take an optional
    `source` for the composite key.
  * lib/core/database/dao/collection_dao.dart (CollectionDao._loadJoinedData,
    CollectionDao.getCollectionCovers), lib/data/repositories/canvas_repository.dart,
    lib/features/mood_grids/widgets/mood_grid_cell_media.dart: Key anime by
    `(id, source)` when hydrating.
  * lib/shared/models/collection_item.dart: Resolve an anime item's source
    from its record instead of hard-coding AniList.
  * lib/shared/utils/cover_image_id.dart (coverImageId),
    lib/shared/models/canvas_item.dart (CanvasItem.mediaCacheId): Namespace
    anime covers by source, like manga.
  * lib/core/services/import_service.dart (ImportService._itemMappingKeys,
    ImportService._registerItemMapping, ImportService._resolveMappedItem),
    lib/data/repositories/collection_repository.dart
    (CollectionRepository.findItem), lib/core/database/database_service.dart
    (DatabaseService.findCollectionItem): Resolve an imported item by
    `(id, source)`.
  * lib/core/services/export_service.dart: Tier-list entries carry the item's
    source; docs/RCOLL_FORMAT.md documents the field.
  * lib/core/services/export_service.dart (ExportService._collectMediaData):
    Key exported anime by `source:externalId`.
  * lib/features/collections/helpers/collection_actions.dart: Route anime
    refresh to Kitsu or AniList by the item's source.
  * lib/core/services/import_service.dart: Remap legacy bare-id anime covers
    to `anilist_` on restore, like manga.
  * lib/features/search/sources/kitsu_anime_source.dart (KitsuAnimeSource),
    search_sources.dart (searchSources): New source, registered.
  * lib/features/search/filters/kitsu_anime_subtype_filter.dart
    (KitsuAnimeSubtypeFilter), kitsu_anime_status_filter.dart
    (KitsuAnimeStatusFilter): New filters.
  * lib/features/search/handlers/media_handlers.dart: Stamp the anime item's
    source and namespace its cover.
  * lib/features/search/widgets/item_details_sheet.dart (ItemDetailsSheet.anime):
    Use the anime's own source for the badge and cached cover.
  * lib/shared/constants/source_catalog.dart (kDataSourceCatalog): Kitsu now
    lists anime and manga.

### Fixed

- **Type counts in a collection follow the subfilters**

  The media-type chevron counts in a collection now follow the active
  subfilters — game platform, manga or anime format — like the All Items
  screen does. Chevron visibility still uses the unfiltered totals.

  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_filter_bar.dart
    (_CollectionFilterBarState._typeCounts): Tally the items that survive
    `CollectionFilters` with every active filter except the type one, instead
    of re-implementing a status-only count. Chevron visibility keeps using the
    unfiltered totals.

- **The collection picker sorts by date the same way the Collections screen does**

  "Newest first" on the Collections screen no longer lists the collections
  oldest first in the picker (add to collection, move, filters). Both screens
  now sort through one shared comparator; alphabetical order was never
  affected.

  * lib/shared/models/collection_list_sort_mode.dart
    (CollectionListSortMode.compare): New shared comparator; the persisted
    flag means Z→A for names and oldest-first for dates.
  * lib/features/collections/screens/home_screen.dart
    (_HomeScreenState._sortCollections),
    lib/shared/widgets/collection_picker_dialog.dart
    (_CollectionPickerContentState._sortedCollections): Both delegate to it.

- **Search filter accent follows the source's media type**

  The filter bar accent derives from the source's media type. Hardcover,
  TVmaze, MangaDex and Kitsu show their media-type colour instead of the
  generic brand orange.

  * lib/features/search/utils/filter_ui.dart (filterAccentForType): Replaces
    `filterAccentForGroup`; maps via `MediaTypeTheme.colorFor`.
  * lib/features/search/widgets/filter_bar.dart, filter_sheet.dart: Colour by
    `source.outputMediaType`.

- **Text export: `{type}` shows the displayed type of a custom item**

  A custom item masquerading as a game / anime / … exported as "Custom";
  now `{type}` uses the display type the user picked. Plain customs still
  say "Custom".

  * lib/core/services/text_export_service.dart
    (TextExportService.formatItem): Label from `displayMediaType`.

- **Mood grid resize no longer drops the cells' data source**

  Shrinking or growing a grid keeps each cell's `source`. MangaBaka manga and
  non-TMDB shows keep resolving against their own provider.

  * lib/core/database/dao/mood_grid_dao.dart (MoodGridDao.resizeMoodGrid):
    Carry `source` when re-inserting cells.

- **Backup restore keeps mood-grid templates**

  Restoring a full backup re-applies the row-caption and cell-label
  templates.

  * lib/core/services/backup_service.dart
    (BackupService._restoreMoodGrids): Apply `caption_template` and
    `cell_label_template` after recreating the grid.

- **Narrow mood-grid exports no longer overflow the footer**

  The export canvas is floored at 320 px wide; a one-column grid at a small
  cell size fits the footer credit line.

  * lib/features/mood_grids/widgets/mood_grid_export_view.dart
    (MoodGridExportView._minWidth): Floor the canvas width at 320.

- **Sparse cache rows no longer wipe episode/chapter/page totals**

  Cache upserts for TV shows, manga and books keep the cached value when the
  incoming one is NULL: a row parsed from a list view (search, recommendations,
  similars) no longer degrades a `38/38` badge to a bare `38`. Adding a TV show
  from recommendations warms the cache like the search flow does, and the
  episode tracker recovers missing totals from the seasons cache for
  already-affected databases.

  * lib/core/database/sparse_upsert.dart (buildPreservingUpsert): New
    `INSERT OR REPLACE` builder that keeps the cached column when the
    incoming value is NULL.
  * lib/core/database/dao/tv_show_dao.dart, manga_dao.dart, book_dao.dart:
    Upserts preserve totals via buildPreservingUpsert.
  * lib/core/services/tv_show_cache_warmer.dart (TvShowCacheWarmer.warm,
    tvShowCacheWarmerProvider): New best-effort warmer filling show details,
    seasons and episodes after an add; called from
    lib/features/search/handlers/tv_show_handler.dart and
    lib/features/collections/screens/item_detail_screen.dart.
  * lib/features/collections/providers/episode_tracker_provider.dart
    (EpisodeTrackerNotifier): Recover missing totals from the seasons cache.

- **Moving a TV show between collections takes its watch progress along**

  Removing a show (or moving it to "uncategorized") keeps its watch marks,
  and adding it back restores the progress.

  * lib/core/database/dao/collection_dao.dart
    (CollectionDao.updateItemCollectionId,
    CollectionDao._transferWatchedEpisodes): Move watched_episodes rows
    with the item; copy when a sibling animation/TV entry stays behind.
  * lib/features/collections/providers/collections_provider.dart
    (CollectionItemsNotifier.moveItem),
    lib/features/collections/helpers/bulk_operations.dart
    (BulkOperations._invalidateAfterMutation): Refresh live episode
    trackers after a move.

- **Re-adding a just-removed show to the same collection works again**

  * lib/features/collections/helpers/collection_actions.dart
    (CollectionActions.removeItem): Invalidate the collected-ids cache on
    removal.

- **Episode progress badge shows "12/22" instead of a bare "12" and now
  also appears on the All Items screen**

  * lib/features/collections/providers/episode_tracker_provider.dart
    (EpisodeTrackerState.totalEpisodes): Expose the resolved episode
    totals to the badge.
  * lib/features/collections/helpers/tracker_card_progress.dart
    (trackerCardProgress): New shared badge helper used by
    lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_items_view.dart and
    lib/features/home/screens/all_items_screen.dart.
  * lib/features/search/handlers/tv_show_handler.dart
    (TvShowHandler._preloadSeasons), lib/core/api/tmdb/tmdb_tv_api.dart
    (TmdbTvApi.getTvShowWithSeasons): Cache full show details on add.

- **Search results no longer badge a title as collected because another provider shares its id**

  A Kitsu anime, MangaDex manga or Hardcover book whose numeric id matches an
  item you own from a different provider no longer shows the "in collection"
  check, and the add-to-collection dialog no longer pre-ticks that item's
  collections. TV already worked this way.

  * lib/shared/models/media_type.dart (MediaType.isMultiSource): New — the
    types whose identity is `(externalId, source)`; reused by
    lib/shared/utils/cover_image_id.dart (coverImageId),
    lib/shared/models/card_link.dart and
    lib/core/database/dao/collection_dao.dart.
  * lib/features/search/widgets/browse_grid.dart (_CollectedIds,
    _BrowseGridState._buildCard): Key manga, anime and book placements by
    `(source, id)` like tv; pass the whole record to the card builder instead
    of seven positional sets.
  * lib/features/search/handlers/simple_media_handler.dart
    (SimpleMediaHandler._collectedCollectionIds): Narrow the placements by the
    item's source.
  * lib/core/database/dao/collection_dao.dart
    (CollectionDao.getCollectedItemInfos): A NULL source resolves to
    `MediaType.defaultSource` instead of always tmdb.
  * lib/features/search/services/search_collection_adder.dart
    (SearchCollectionAdder.addToCollections,
    SearchCollectionAdder.pickCollection): Take the item's source and filter
    the existing placements by it.
  * docs/RCOLL_FORMAT.md: Document the per-source TV poster cache key.

- **Anime covers in search results download on every visit**

  The browse grid read the cover under the bare anime id while every other
  screen wrote it namespaced by provider.

  * lib/features/search/widgets/browse_grid.dart: Build the anime cache id
    through `coverImageId`.

- **A card link to a TVmaze show or Kitsu anime can open the wrong item**

  `[[card:…]]` tokens now carry the provider for every multi-source media
  type, not only manga. Tokens written by earlier versions have no provider
  and resolve as before.

  * lib/shared/models/card_link.dart (buildCardLinkToken, CardLinkRef.source):
    Emit `src=` for manga, anime, tv shows and books.
  * lib/core/database/dao/collection_dao.dart (CollectionDao.resolveCardLink):
    Filter by source for those types, defaulting a NULL column to the media
    type's default source.

- **Anime source material survives importing a pre-0.40 backup**

  Before v60 the anime cache stored the source material ("Manga", "Light
  Novel") in the column that now holds the provider. Restoring an older
  `.xcollx` kept the field blank.

  * lib/shared/models/anime.dart (Anime.fromDb): Read an unrecognised `source`
    value as the source material when `source_material` is absent.
  * lib/shared/models/data_source.dart (DataSource.tryFromName): New —
    null-returning parser behind `fromNameOr`.

- **Fixed row overflows on narrow layouts**

  * lib/features/collections/widgets/episode_tracker_section.dart
    (EpisodeTrackerSection.build): The header title ellipsizes instead of
    overflowing next to the watched counter.
  * lib/shared/widgets/media_poster_card.dart (MediaPosterCard): The tag
    badge shrinks on very narrow cards instead of overflowing.

### Changed

- **Schema, migrations and models moved to a pure-Dart core package**

  No user-visible change. The database schema and migration chain moved
  verbatim into `packages/core`, a pure-Dart package with no Flutter
  dependency, and the model layer (`lib/shared/models/`) dropped its
  Flutter / l10n imports — colors, icons and localized labels now live in
  UI extension files under `lib/shared/constants/`.

  * packages/core/: New package holding schema.dart and migrations
    (MigrationRegistry, MigrationV1 … MigrationV60), moved unchanged from
    lib/core/database/; packages/core/pubspec.yaml wired as a path dependency
    from the app pubspec.yaml.
  * packages/core/lib/database/migrations/migration_runner.dart
    (MigrationRunner): New — runs the chain for a fresh database and the
    pending tail for an upgrade; called from
    lib/core/database/database_service.dart (_onCreate, _onUpgrade).
  * packages/core/lib/database/schema.dart (DatabaseSchema): Drop the unused
    createAnimeCacheTable helper — no migration calls it and its shape
    predates the v60 rebuild.
  * docs/ARCHITECTURE.md: Describe the core package.
  * lib/shared/constants/*_ui.dart, lib/shared/utils/color_hex.dart
    (ColorHex): New presentation extensions and hex color codec replacing
    the in-model getters.

- **Provider identity (name, group, brand icon) now comes from DataSource**

  Provider names now come from `DataSource.label`, a new derived
  `DataSource.key` replaces the per-source `groupId` literals, and search
  sources declare a single `dataSource` from which their picker group and
  brand icon derive. No visible change; error dialogs, import results and the
  source picker keep their current wording.

  * lib/shared/models/data_source.dart (DataSource.key): New lowercase
    provider key derived from the enum member name.
  * lib/features/search/models/search_source.dart (SearchSource.dataSource,
    SearchSource.groupId, SearchSource.groupName, SearchSource.iconAsset):
    New abstract provider getter; group id, group name and brand asset now
    derive from it.
  * lib/features/search/sources/anilist_anime_source.dart,
    anilist_manga_source.dart, comicvine_source.dart, fantlab_source.dart,
    google_books_source.dart, hardcover_source.dart, igdb_games_source.dart,
    kitsu_anime_source.dart, kitsu_manga_source.dart, mangabaka_source.dart,
    mangadex_source.dart, openlibrary_source.dart, tmdb_anime_source.dart,
    tmdb_movies_source.dart, tmdb_tv_source.dart, tvmaze_tv_source.dart,
    vndb_source.dart: Replace groupId/groupName/iconAsset overrides with
    the dataSource declaration.
  * lib/core/api/anilist/anilist_graphql_client.dart, comicvine_api.dart,
    google_books_api.dart, fantlab/fantlab_http_client.dart,
    hardcover/hardcover_graphql_client.dart, igdb/igdb_http_client.dart,
    kitsu/kitsu_http_client.dart, mangabaka/mangabaka_http_client.dart,
    mangadex/mangadex_http_client.dart,
    openlibrary/openlibrary_http_client.dart, tmdb/tmdb_http_client.dart,
    tvmaze/tvmaze_http_client.dart, vndb/vndb_http_client.dart: apiName in
    error details from DataSource.label.
  * lib/core/import/sources/anilist/anilist_import_service.dart
    (AniListImportService.displayName),
    lib/core/import/sources/hardcover/hardcover_import_service.dart
    (HardcoverImportService.displayName),
    lib/core/import/sources/igdb_list/igdb_list_import_service.dart
    (IgdbListImportService.displayName): displayName and result sourceName
    from DataSource.label.
  * lib/features/settings/content/credentials_content.dart,
    lib/features/settings/content/hardcover_import_content.dart: Source
    names from DataSource.label.
  * lib/shared/constants/source_catalog.dart (kSearchGroupToSources):
    Deleted — the parallel group→sources map is derivable from
    SearchSource.dataSource.
  * lib/shared/models/data_source.dart (DataSource.brandName): New — full
    attribution name, equal to `label` unless the badge abbreviates it.
  * lib/features/settings/content/credits_content.dart (_Provider): Drop the
    parallel table of provider names; the credits card renders
    `DataSource.brandName`.

- **Enum-owned UI metadata: nav tabs, discover sections, statuses, sort modes**

  Icons and labels moved onto their enums: NavTab (bottom bar, rail and
  welcome tour render from one definition), DiscoverSectionId (feed and
  customize sheet), and
  TextExportSortMode (copy-as-text dialog). ItemStatus gains a shared
  English displayLabel used by the text exporter and MAL import notes; MAL
  notes now write "Not Started" / "In Progress" (Title Case) instead of
  "Not started" / "In progress".

  * lib/shared/navigation/nav_tab.dart (NavTab.icon, NavTab.selectedIcon,
    NavTab.localizedLabel): New enum accessors.
  * lib/shared/navigation/nav_destinations.dart (buildNavDestinations),
    lib/features/welcome/widgets/menu_tour_items.dart (buildMenuTourItems):
    Render from NavTab accessors; local icon/label switches deleted.
  * lib/features/search/providers/discover_provider.dart
    (DiscoverSectionId.icon, DiscoverSectionId.localizedLabel): New enum
    accessors.
  * lib/features/search/widgets/discover_feed.dart (DiscoverFeed),
    lib/features/search/widgets/discover_customize_sheet.dart
    (DiscoverCustomizeSheet): Render from DiscoverSectionId accessors; the
    local section-meta map deleted.
  * lib/shared/models/item_status.dart (ItemStatus.displayLabel,
    ItemStatus.tryFromString): New shared English label and null-safe
    parser.
  * lib/core/services/text_export_service.dart (TextExportService,
    TextExportSortMode.localizedLabel): Status label from
    ItemStatus.displayLabel; new localised sort-mode label.
  * lib/core/import/sources/mal/mal_import_service.dart (MalImportService):
    Status label in notes from ItemStatus.displayLabel.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/copy_as_text_dialog.dart
    (_CopyAsTextDialogState): Sort menu built by looping
    TextExportSortMode.values.

- **Single-source cleanup: stored enum values, defaults and dead labels**

  Remaining hardcoded copies of enum-owned strings replaced with the enum
  accessor, the ImageType enum moved out of the image cache service into
  shared models, and unused label fields dropped. Purely internal.

  * lib/shared/utils/anime_manga_title_language.dart
    (AnimeMangaTitleLanguage.defaultId): New app-wide default id constant.
  * lib/core/services/discord_rpc_service.dart
    (DiscordRpcService.updatePresence),
    lib/core/services/text_export_service.dart
    (TextExportService.applyTemplate),
    lib/features/collections/helpers/collection_filters.dart
    (CollectionFilters.apply),
    lib/features/collections/providers/sort_utils.dart (applySortMode),
    lib/features/settings/providers/settings_provider.dart (SettingsKeys),
    lib/shared/constants/tmdb_content_languages.dart
    (anilistTitleLanguageForContent): 'romaji' / 'english' / 'native'
    defaults from AnimeMangaTitleLanguage.
  * lib/shared/models/image_type.dart (ImageType): New home, moved verbatim
    from image_cache_service.dart (which keeps a re-export).
  * lib/shared/models/canvas_item.dart, collection_item.dart,
    cover_info.dart: Import ImageType from the model, not the service.
  * lib/core/database/dao/collection_dao.dart
    (CollectionDao.getCollectionStats, CollectionDao.getItemIdsByExternalId,
    CollectionDao.clearAllData): Stats switches parse MediaType / ItemStatus
    enums instead of raw strings; item lookup and clear-all moved here from
    DatabaseService.
  * lib/core/database/database_service.dart
    (DatabaseService.getItemIdsByExternalId, DatabaseService.clearAllData):
    Delegate to CollectionDao.
  * lib/core/services/import_service.dart (ImportService),
    lib/data/repositories/canvas_repository.dart
    (CanvasRepository.deleteGameItem),
    lib/features/collections/providers/tracker_provider.dart
    (TrackerDetailNotifier),
    lib/features/settings/screens/demo_collections_screen.dart
    (_DemoCollectionsScreenState): media_type strings from MediaType.value /
    CanvasItemType.value.
  * lib/features/collections/models/collections_index.dart
    (RemoteCollection.fromJson, RemoteCollection.isFull),
    lib/core/services/xcoll_file.dart (XcollFile): 'light' / 'full' from
    ExportFormat.value.
  * lib/shared/models/collection_sort_mode.dart (CollectionSortMode),
    lib/shared/models/search_sort.dart (SearchSortField): Drop unused
    displayLabel / shortLabel / description fields — UI uses the localised
    accessors.

- **Season rows show watch progress and a "mark next episode" button**

  Each collapsed season has a progress bar alongside its watched count. A new
  button marks the season's next unwatched episode in one tap, loading the
  season from its source first if needed.

  * lib/features/collections/widgets/episode_tracker_section.dart
    (_SeasonExpansionTileState._markNextWatched): Progress bar in the season
    subtitle and a mark-next-episode action.
  * lib/l10n/app_*.arb (markNextWatched): New key.

- **Mood grid became its own feature module and got a lighter screen**

  Files moved from `lib/features/tier_lists/` to `lib/features/mood_grids/`
  (models, DAO and migrations stay where they were). The detail screen
  resolves cell media in one query per media type instead of one per cell,
  mounts the offscreen export tree only while exporting, and no longer
  re-reads the grid list on every cell edit.

  * lib/features/mood_grids/: New home for mood-grid providers, screens,
    services and widgets; imports updated in
    lib/features/tier_lists/screens/tier_lists_screen.dart and
    lib/features/settings/content/database_content.dart.
  * lib/features/mood_grids/widgets/mood_grid_cell_media.dart
    (resolveMoodGridCellMediaBatch): New batched resolver.
  * lib/features/mood_grids/providers/mood_grid_detail_provider.dart
    (MoodGridDetailNotifier.build, MoodGridDetailNotifier.resize): Use the
    batched resolver; cell-level edits no longer invalidate
    moodGridsProvider.
  * lib/features/mood_grids/screens/mood_grid_detail_screen.dart
    (_MoodGridDetailScreenState._exportAsImage): Export view mounted on
    demand.
  * lib/features/mood_grids/widgets/mood_grid_view.dart,
    lib/features/mood_grids/widgets/mood_grid_export_view.dart: Cell
    lookup via a position map instead of a per-cell linear search.

- **Episode tracker got season posters, episode stills and overviews**

  Season rows show the season poster with an all-watched badge and the air
  year; episode rows show the episode still (dimmed with a check badge once
  watched) and a two-line overview that expands on tap. The episode
  checkbox is gone — tapping the row toggles watched, same as before.
  Season posters and episode stills are cached on disk for offline use.

  * lib/features/collections/widgets/episode_tracker_section.dart
    (_SeasonLeading, _WatchedBadge, _ExpandableOverview, _EpisodeTileState):
    Season poster with an all-watched badge and air year, episode still,
    expandable overview, row-tap toggle in place of the checkbox.
  * lib/shared/models/image_type.dart (ImageType.tvSeasonPoster,
    ImageType.tvEpisodeStill): Cache folders for the new artwork.

- **Decouple the episode tracker and release calendar from TMDB**

  Seasons, episodes and watch progress are keyed by `(source, show id)`
  instead of a bare TMDB id, and season/episode fetching goes through a
  provider-agnostic `TvEpisodeSource` interface. TMDB is the first
  implementation and existing data is migrated as TMDB. No user-visible
  behaviour changes yet.

  * lib/core/api/episode_source/tv_episode_source.dart (TvEpisodeSource,
    tvEpisodeSourceResolverProvider): New — season/episode source
    interface and per-DataSource resolver (unknown sources fall back to
    TMDB).
  * lib/core/api/episode_source/tmdb_episode_source.dart
    (TmdbEpisodeSource): New — TMDB implementation over TmdbApi.
  * packages/core/lib/database/migrations/migration_v57.dart (MigrationV57): New —
    rebuilds tv_shows_cache with a (tmdb_id, source) primary key, adds
    `source` to the UNIQUE keys of tv_seasons_cache, tv_episodes_cache
    and watched_episodes, backfills existing rows as 'tmdb', re-scopes
    the collection_items unique indexes so tv_show includes source
    (idx_ci_coll_tv, idx_ci_uncat_tv), backfills
    collection_items.source and mood_grid_cells.source for tv shows, and
    drops watched_episodes rows whose collection no longer exists before the
    rebuild re-inserts them under the foreign key.
  * lib/core/database/database_service.dart (DatabaseService._initDatabase),
    packages/core/lib/database/migrations/migration_registry.dart
    (MigrationRegistry.all): Version 57.
  * lib/shared/models/tv_show.dart (TvShow), tv_season.dart (TvSeason),
    tv_episode.dart (TvEpisode): New `source` field (default tmdb) in
    fromDb/toDb/copyWith/==/hashCode.
  * lib/shared/models/data_source.dart (DataSource.fromNameOr): New —
    parse with an explicit fallback.
  * lib/shared/models/media_type.dart (MediaType.defaultSource): New —
    fallback source for rows with a NULL source column.
  * lib/core/database/dao/tv_show_dao.dart (TvShowDao.getTvShowByTmdbId,
    TvShowDao.getTvSeasonsByShowId, TvShowDao.getEpisodesByShowId,
    TvShowDao.getEpisodesByShowAndSeason, TvShowDao.clearEpisodesByShow,

## [0.39.0] - 2026-07-18

### Added

- **"What's new" dialog after an app update**

  On the first launch with a new version the app shows hand-written
  release notes from the bundled assets/whats_new.md (a small file the
  release process overwrites each release — not the full changelog) in
  a dialog; closing it remembers the version so the notes appear only
  once. English only for now. A fresh install shows nothing. Settings →
  About → "What's New" reopens the current notes any time; a debug
  preview also lives in Developer Tools → "What's New Preview".

  * lib/core/services/whats_new_service.dart (WhatsNewService,
    WhatsNewContent, whatsNewServiceProvider, whatsNewProvider): New —
    version gate in SharedPreferences (changelog_seen_version),
    `# X.Y.Z` section extraction, display formatting, previewLatest.
  * lib/shared/widgets/whats_new_dialog.dart (WhatsNewDialog,
    showWhatsNewDialog): New.
  * lib/shared/navigation/app_shell.dart (_AppShellState.build): Listen
    to whatsNewProvider, show the dialog post-frame, mark seen on close.
  * lib/features/settings/screens/debug_hub_screen.dart
    (DebugHubScreen._previewWhatsNew): Debug preview tile.
  * lib/features/settings/screens/settings_screen.dart
    (_SettingsScreenState._showChangelog): About → "What's New" tile
    (settingsChangelog, settingsChangelogEmpty l10n keys).
  * assets/whats_new.md: New — current release's notes; pubspec.yaml
    bundles it.
  * .claude/skills/release/SKILL.md: Step 7.6 — every release overwrites
    assets/whats_new.md with condensed user-facing notes.

- **Spanish (es) localization**

  Fourth interface language. Selectable in Settings → App Language and in
  the welcome wizard, where picking Spanish also defaults the TMDB content
  language to es-ES and the AniList title mode to romaji (unless the user
  already picked a content language by hand). All 1493 strings translated.

  * lib/l10n/app_es.arb, lib/l10n/app_localizations_es.dart (SEs): New.
  * lib/l10n/app_localizations.dart (S.supportedLocales, lookupS): Register es.
  * lib/features/settings/screens/settings_screen.dart (_kAppLanguageNames,
    _SettingsScreenState._showLanguagePicker): Add Español; replace the
    hardcoded per-language tile value and four copy-pasted dialog options
    with a single locale→name map driving both.
  * lib/features/welcome/widgets/welcome_step_language.dart
    (_WelcomeStepLanguageState.build): Add the Español option, shift
    WelcomeReveal indices.
  * lib/shared/constants/tmdb_content_languages.dart (_kUiToContentLanguage):
    Map es → es-ES.
  * README.md, docs/index.html,
    fastlane/metadata/android/en-US/full_description.txt: List Spanish
    among supported languages.
  * test/features/welcome/widgets/welcome_step_language_test.dart: Cover the
    Spanish option (appLanguage=es, tmdbLanguage=es-ES); ensureVisible before
    tapping the content dropdown pushed off-screen by the fourth option.
  * test/features/settings/screens/settings_screen_test.dart: New test —
    picking a language in the dialog persists it to SharedPreferences.

- **Poster cards: bottom banner with title, meta and progress on the poster**

  Grid and compact cards no longer reserve a text block below the poster:
  the poster fills the whole cell and a translucent panel at its bottom
  carries the title (two lines, expanding on hover/focus), a meta line
  (API rating, platform, year, media type, genre) and an always-visible
  row with the status dot, watch/read progress and the tag chip. TMDB
  shows now display live episode-tracker counts on collection cards.
  Grids and horizontal rows switched to the true 2:3 poster ratio.

  * lib/shared/widgets/media_poster_card.dart (_MediaPosterCardState._buildBottomBanner):
    New — solid translucent banner; title/subtitle block below the poster
    removed; status dot and progress pill moved into the banner row;
    time-to-beat badge moved to the top-left corner; non-split ratings
    render in the subtitle line instead of the top-left badge.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_items_view.dart
    (_trackerProgress): New — episode progress for tvShow/animation items
    from episodeTrackerNotifierProvider (watched/totalEpisodes).
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_items_view.dart,
    lib/features/home/screens/all_items_screen.dart,
    lib/features/search/widgets/browse_grid.dart: childAspectRatio
    0.55 → AppSpacing.posterAspectRatio.
  * lib/features/search/widgets/discover_row.dart,
    lib/features/search/widgets/discover_feed.dart,
    lib/features/recommendations/widgets/recommendation_row.dart,
    lib/shared/widgets/book_carousel.dart,
    lib/features/collections/widgets/recommendations_section.dart:
    row height derived from posterWidth / AppSpacing.posterAspectRatio.

- **Laboratory section in Settings with card banner design lab**

  New "Laboratory" settings group (visible in release builds too) hosts
  the experimental card-banner gallery: eight banner layout variants
  rendered on real posters from a chosen collection, with hover
  behaviour, for side-by-side comparison. A banner at the top links to
  the project Discord channel to vote for the favourite design.

  * lib/features/settings/screens/card_banner_debug_screen.dart
    (CardBannerDebugScreen, _VotePrompt): New — variant gallery (solid
    panel, gradient, frosted glass, stats strip, one-line meta, status
    stripe, split meta, label-in-progress-bar) plus a Discord vote link.
  * lib/features/settings/screens/settings_screen.dart: Laboratory
    group with the card designs tile.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb, lib/l10n/app_zh.arb,
    lib/l10n/app_es.arb (settingsLaboratory, settingsLaboratoryCardDesigns,
    settingsLaboratoryCardDesignsSubtitle): New keys.

- **Hardcover book source: search and library import**

  Hardcover (hardcover.app) joins the book providers. Search returns the
  full card (authors, genres, moods, series, ratings, ISBNs) in one
  request with six sort options; the importer pulls a user's library by
  username — statuses, ratings, reading dates, re-read counts, reviews
  and the Hardcover add date — with "add new only" / "overwrite" modes.
  Books flagged as owned get the global "Owned" tag. Requires a free
  personal API token (Settings → API Credentials); tokens reset every
  January 1st and the app says so when one expires.

  * lib/core/api/hardcover_api.dart (HardcoverApi, hardcoverApiProvider): New —
    facade over the GraphQL layer, token wiring, validateApiKey.
  * lib/core/api/hardcover/hardcover_graphql_client.dart (HardcoverGraphQLClient):
    New — single-endpoint POST transport, Bearer auth, 401/429 mapping.
  * lib/core/api/hardcover/hardcover_queries.dart (HardcoverQueries),
    lib/core/api/hardcover/hardcover_types.dart (HardcoverApiException,
    HardcoverAuthException, HardcoverRateLimitException,
    HardcoverUserNotFoundException, HardcoverUserBookEntry): New.
  * lib/core/api/hardcover/hardcover_search_api.dart (HardcoverSearchApi):
    New — paginated search, book-by-id refetch.
  * lib/core/api/hardcover/hardcover_user_library_api.dart
    (HardcoverUserLibraryApi): New — user lookup, library count, 500-row pages.
  * lib/core/import/sources/hardcover/hardcover_import_service.dart
    (HardcoverImportService, HardcoverImportOptions,
    hardcoverImportServiceProvider): New — status/rating/date mapping,
    Owned tag, date_added → added_at.
  * lib/features/search/sources/hardcover_source.dart (HardcoverSource): New —
    search source with relevance/popular/top-rated/most-voted/most-read/newest
    sorts.
  * lib/features/settings/screens/hardcover_import_screen.dart
    (HardcoverImportScreen), lib/features/settings/content/hardcover_import_content.dart
    (HardcoverImportContent): New — import form and progress UI.
  * lib/shared/models/book.dart (Book.fromHardcoverDocument, Book.fromHardcoverBook):
    New factories for the search document and graph book shapes.
  * lib/shared/models/data_source.dart (DataSource.hardcover): New enum value.
  * lib/features/settings/providers/settings_provider.dart
    (SettingsKeys.hardcoverApiKey, SettingsKeys.hardcoverUsername,
    SettingsState.hardcoverApiKey, SettingsNotifier.setHardcoverApiKey,
    SettingsNotifier.validateHardcoverKey): Token storage and validation;
    the setter strips a pasted "Bearer " prefix.
  * lib/core/services/api_key_initializer.dart (ApiKeys.hardcoverApiKey): Load
    the token at startup.
  * lib/features/settings/content/credentials_content.dart
    (_buildHardcoverSection), lib/features/welcome/widgets/welcome_step_sources.dart
    (_KeyEditorState, _KeyBadge): Token entry in Credentials and the welcome
    wizard.
  * lib/features/settings/content/credits_content.dart,
    lib/shared/constants/source_catalog.dart (kDataSourceCatalog,
    kSearchGroupToSources): Catalog and attribution entries.
  * lib/features/search/handlers/media_handlers.dart (_fetchFullBook),
    lib/features/collections/helpers/collection_actions.dart: Refetch stored
    Hardcover items.
  * lib/features/search/models/search_source.dart (BrowseSortOption.label):
    Add the `most_read` sort label.
  * lib/features/search/sources/search_sources.dart (searchSources): Register
    the source.
  * lib/core/services/import_service.dart (ImportStage.fetchingBooks): New stage.
  * lib/core/database/dao/global_tag_dao.dart (GlobalTagDao.addTagToItems):
    New — additive batch tag link used by the Owned tag.
  * lib/shared/theme/app_assets.dart (AppAssets.iconHardcoverColor),
    assets/images/icon_hardcover_color.png: Brand icon.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb, lib/l10n/app_zh.arb: Hardcover
    strings plus shared import keys (importUsername, importMode,
    importModeNewOnly, importModeOverwrite, importNewCollectionName,
    importNewCollectionDefault, importFetchingBooks, importAddingItems,
    importProcessingItem, importImportedCount, importUpdatedCount,
    importUserNotFound, importEmptyUsername, importFailed, browseSortMostRead).
  * README.md, docs/index.html: List the new source.

- **Hardcover edition picker with a language filter**

  A Hardcover book's detail sheet in search shows an editions strip
  (most-owned first) with language chips — Hardcover's canonical title can
  be in any language, so picking e.g. the EN printing swaps in its
  localized title (the old one is kept as the original title), cover,
  ISBN, publisher, language and year. The picked edition is recorded as a
  `#edition-{id}` fragment on the item's external URL — fragments never
  reach the server, so the link keeps resolving while the pick survives
  "Refresh from source" without a schema migration.

  * lib/core/api/hardcover/hardcover_queries.dart
    (HardcoverQueries.editionsByBook, HardcoverQueries.editionById): New
    queries.
  * lib/core/api/hardcover/hardcover_types.dart (HardcoverEdition): New.
  * lib/core/api/hardcover/hardcover_search_api.dart
    (HardcoverSearchApi.getEditions, HardcoverSearchApi.getEdition),
    lib/core/api/hardcover_api.dart (HardcoverApi.getEditions,
    HardcoverApi.getEdition): New endpoints.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/hardcover_edition_picker.dart
    (HardcoverEditionsSection, showHardcoverEditionPicker,
    applyHardcoverEdition, reapplyHardcoverEdition,
    hardcoverEditionIdFromExternalUrl, hardcoverEditionIdFromCoverUrl):
    New — inline strip with language chips, modal picker grouped by
    language, edition overlay and recovery helpers.
  * lib/features/search/widgets/hardcover_book_sheet.dart
    (HardcoverBookSheet): New — detail sheet host with the editions strip.
  * lib/features/search/handlers/media_handlers.dart: Route Hardcover books
    to the sheet and apply the picked edition on add.

- **"Refresh from source" lets a book switch editions**

  For Fantlab and Hardcover books the refresh action first opens the
  edition picker (current edition highlighted) — added the RU printing by
  mistake, pick the EN one and refresh with it. Dismissing the sheet
  refreshes keeping the current edition; previously a refresh silently
  reset the book to the source's default edition, discarding the picked
  cover and metadata.

  * lib/features/collections/helpers/collection_actions.dart
    (CollectionActions.refreshItemFromApi, _refreshItemWork): Show the
    picker for Fantlab / Hardcover books; apply the fresh pick or re-apply
    the stored one.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/fantlab_edition_picker.dart
    (reapplyFantlabEdition): New — recovers the picked edition from the
    cached cover URL onto the refetched work; showFantlabEditionPicker is
    now actually wired up.

- **Cover size slider in Settings → Appearance**

  A 70–160% slider scales the item cards in every grid: the collection
  grid, "All items" and Browse. Desktop scales the max card width;
  phones and tablets recalculate the column count (2–8). The grid
  updates live while dragging; the value is saved on release.

  * lib/features/settings/providers/settings_provider.dart
    (SettingsKeys.cardScale, SettingsState.cardScale,
    SettingsNotifier.setCardScale): New setting, clamped to 0.7–1.6,
    persisted in SharedPreferences; reset by clearSettings.
  * lib/features/settings/screens/settings_screen.dart (_CardScaleSlider):
    New — slider tile with live preview (persist: false while dragging).
  * lib/shared/theme/app_spacing.dart (AppSpacing.desktopMaxCardWidth,
    AppSpacing.scaledColumns): New — the 170px desktop card width moved
    here from three copies; column-count helper for fixed-count grids.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_items_view.dart
    (CollectionItemsView._buildGridView),
    lib/features/home/screens/all_items_screen.dart
    (_AllItemsScreenState._buildGridView),
    lib/features/search/widgets/browse_grid.dart
    (_BrowseGridState._buildGridDelegate): Apply the scale to grid
    delegates.

- **Readable import errors with copyable details**

  A failed import no longer shows a raw exception dump. Error snacks
  grow a "Details" action opening a dialog with the full message and a
  copyable debug block (request, status code, cause). The import result
  screen lists per-item errors in an expandable card with copy-all and
  adds a copy button for the fatal error.

  * lib/shared/widgets/error_details_dialog.dart (showErrorDetailsDialog,
    copyErrorDetails): New — copyable error dialog and clipboard helper.
  * lib/shared/extensions/snackbar_extension.dart
    (SnackBarExtension.showErrorSnack): New — error snack with the
    "Details" action.
  * lib/shared/models/universal_import_result.dart
    (UniversalImportResult.fatalDetail): New — debug detail carried next
    to fatalError.
  * lib/core/api/api_error_extract.dart (extractApiError): Also unwraps
    GoogleBooksApiException, HardcoverApiException, FantlabApiException,
    KodiApiException, ScreenScraperApiException.
  * lib/core/import/sources/steam/steam_import_service.dart,
    lib/core/import/sources/trakt/trakt_import_service.dart,
    lib/core/import/sources/igdb_list/igdb_list_import_service.dart,
    lib/core/import/sources/kinorium/kinorium_import_service.dart:
    Route unexpected exceptions through extractApiError and attach the
    detail to the failure result.
  * lib/core/import/sources/custom_file/custom_cards_import_service.dart:
    Attach the stack trace as the failure detail.
  * lib/features/settings/content/anilist_import_content.dart,
    hardcover_import_content.dart, mal_import_content.dart,
    ra_import_content.dart, steam_import_content.dart,
    trakt_import_content.dart, igdb_list_import_content.dart,
    kinorium_import_content.dart, custom_cards_import_content.dart,
    lib/features/settings/screens/custom_cards_preview_screen.dart,
    lib/features/collections/screens/home_screen.dart: Show failures via
    showErrorSnack with the detail attached.
  * lib/features/settings/screens/import_result_screen.dart (_ErrorsCard):
    New — expandable per-item error list with copy-all; copy button for
    the fatal error.
  * lib/shared/utils/custom_cards_parse_error_l10n.dart
    (localizedParseError): Moved out of custom_cards_import_content.dart
    so the create-item dialog can reuse it.

- **Reading/watching progress on item cards and in the table**

  Anime, manga, books and custom items show their progress right on the
  poster: a pill next to the status dot (`12/24`, `V2 · 45/120`) and a
  thin bar along the bottom edge when the total is known. The collection
  table gains a read-only Progress column. The All Items list is patched
  in place on every progress change, so the pill stays fresh without a
  full reload.

  * lib/shared/utils/item_card_progress.dart (ItemCardProgress,
    itemCardProgress): New — builds the label and 0..1 fraction per
    media type.
  * lib/shared/widgets/media_poster_card.dart (MediaPosterCard.progress):
    New — progress pill and bottom-edge bar on grid/compact cards.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_items_view.dart,
    lib/features/home/screens/all_items_screen.dart: Pass the item's
    progress to the card.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_table/table_fields.dart,
    table_columns.dart, table_rows.dart (TableFields.progress): New
    read-only Progress column.
  * lib/features/home/providers/all_items_provider.dart
    (AllItemsNotifier.updateProgressLocally): New — in-place patch,
    mirrors updateStatusLocally.
  * lib/features/collections/providers/collections_provider.dart
    (CollectionItemsNotifier.updateProgress): Sync the All Items copy
    via the local patch.

- **Prefill the custom item form from a JSON/CSV file**

  The create-item dialog gets an upload button that runs the bulk-import
  parser on a picked file and fills the form from the first valid row.
  Only fields present in the file overwrite current values; personal
  fields (status, rating, dates) are ignored.

  * lib/features/collections/widgets/create_custom_item_dialog.dart
    (_CreateCustomItemDialogState._fillFromFile, _applyEntry,
    _resolvePlatformId): New.

- **Drag tag chips into a manual per-item order in the item card**

  Tag chips in the item detail card can be dragged into a custom order —
  immediate drag on desktop, long-press drag on Android. The order is
  per item: until a chip is dragged, the item keeps following the global
  tag order from the tag manager, and newly attached tags go to the end
  of a manually ordered item. The first tag by that order is what item
  cards and the table's primary-tag sort show. The arrangement survives
  export/import (`tag_names` is written in display order and restored as
  explicit positions only when it differs from the global order) and is
  carried along when an item is cloned to another collection.

  * lib/core/database/migrations/migration_v56.dart (MigrationV56): New —
    nullable `item_tags.position` column via addColumnIfAbsent.
  * lib/core/database/migrations/migration_registry.dart (MigrationRegistry.all),
    lib/core/database/database_service.dart (_initDatabase): Register v56,
    bump version to 56.
  * lib/core/database/dao/global_tag_dao.dart (GlobalTagDao.getTagIdsByItem,
    GlobalTagDao.getTagIdsForItems, GlobalTagDao.getAllItemTags): Return
    ordered lists via a JOIN — manual positions first, NULLs after in
    global order (shared _linkOrderBy clause).
  * lib/core/database/dao/global_tag_dao.dart (GlobalTagDao.setItemTags):
    No longer deletes-and-reinserts every link; surviving links keep their
    manual position, new links get NULL.
  * lib/core/database/dao/global_tag_dao.dart (GlobalTagDao.setItemTagPositions,
    GlobalTagDao.copyItemTags): New — persist a per-item reorder; copy links
    with positions when cloning an item.
  * lib/features/collections/providers/item_tags_provider.dart
    (ItemTagsNotifier): State is now Map<int, List<int>> in display order;
    new reorderItemTags and refreshFromDb; setItemTags re-reads the item's
    order from the DAO.
  * lib/features/collections/providers/global_tags_provider.dart
    (GlobalTagsNotifier.reorder): Refresh the cached per-item lists after a
    global reorder so fallback-ordered items follow it.
  * lib/shared/models/tag.dart (TagListProjection.orderedFor,
    TagListProjection.primaryFor, TagListProjection.byId, TagMapProjection):
    Projections follow the ids order (the item's display order); map-based
    overloads let eager loops hoist the id → tag map.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/item_tags_section.dart (ItemTagsSection,
    _TagDragData): Chips are Draggable/LongPressDraggable drop targets with a
    hover highlight; the drag payload is scoped to the owning item.
  * lib/core/services/export_service.dart (ExportService._collectTagData):
    Write `tag_names` in the item's display order.
  * lib/core/services/import_service.dart (ImportService._importTags): Restore
    explicit positions when the imported order differs from the global one.
  * lib/features/collections/providers/collections_provider.dart
    (CollectionItemsNotifier.cloneItem),
    lib/features/collections/helpers/bulk_operations.dart (cloneItemsToCollection):
    Clone tags via copyItemTags so the manual order travels with the copy.
  * lib/features/collections/screens/collection_screen.dart,
    lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_items_view.dart,
    lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_table/collection_table_view.dart,
    lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_table/table_rows.dart,
    lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_screen/collection_bulk_action_bar.dart,
    lib/features/collections/widgets/copy_as_text_dialog.dart,
    lib/features/collections/widgets/tag_management_dialog.dart,
    lib/features/collections/helpers/collection_filters.dart,
    lib/features/home/screens/all_items_screen.dart: Consume the ordered
    Map<int, List<int>> item-tag map.
  * docs/RCOLL_FORMAT.md: Document the `tag_names` order semantics.

- **Tag picker: search field and an explicit "Create" row**

  The tag picker's text field now searches: typing filters the tag list
  as you type, with a clear button. When the query matches no existing
  tag exactly, a highlighted "Create «query»" row with a plus icon
  appears at the top of the list — tapping it (or pressing Enter)
  creates the tag and selects it; Enter on an exact match just selects
  it. Replaces the old bare name field whose plus button users didn't
  recognise as "add new tag".

  * lib/features/collections/widgets/tag_picker_dialog.dart
    (_TagPickerDialogState._submitQuery, _buildCreateTile): Search-driven
    list, create row, Enter handling.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb, lib/l10n/app_zh.arb
    (tagCreateNamed): New key.

- **Sort by start date and completion date**

  Two new sort modes in the collection sort menu, alongside the existing
  ones: "Start Date" and "Completion Date" (the dates filled in on the
  item card). Recent first by default, direction toggle flips to oldest
  first; items without the date go last, ordered by name.

  * lib/shared/models/collection_sort_mode.dart (CollectionSortMode.startDate,
    CollectionSortMode.completionDate): New enum values + localized labels;
    comments translated to English.
  * lib/features/collections/providers/sort_utils.dart (applySortMode,
    _compareNullableDatesDesc): New comparators, shared null-last helper.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb, lib/l10n/app_zh.arb
    (sortStartDateDisplay, sortStartDateShort, sortCompletionDateDisplay,
    sortCompletionDateShort): New keys.

### Changed

- **Specials (season 0) listed in the episode tracker, excluded from progress**

  The Specials season is no longer hidden: it appears last in the season
  list and can be tracked, but its episodes do not count toward the
  show's watched/total progress or the automatic status — TMDB's episode
  totals exclude specials, so counting them skewed completion.

  * lib/features/collections/providers/episode_tracker_provider.dart
    (EpisodeTrackerState.totalWatchedCount,
    EpisodeTrackerState.totalEpisodeCount,
    EpisodeTrackerNotifier._updateAutoStatus): Skip season 0; the
    all-seasons-loaded fallback counts only regular seasons.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/episode_tracker_section.dart
    (_SeasonsListWidgetState.build): Show specials last instead of
    skipping them.

- **All font sizes bumped by 1px on mobile**

  The desktop-tuned type scale read small on phones; every text style
  now gains one pixel on mobile.

  * lib/shared/theme/app_typography.dart (AppTypography): Styles are
    computed with a kIsMobile-driven bump (const → final).

- **Tighter item card action bar and subfilter row spacing**

  Icons in the item detail top bar are slightly smaller (18px) with
  compact tap boxes, so the six actions no longer read sparse. The gap
  under the sub-filter chip row is halved.

  * lib/features/collections/widgets/item_detail/item_detail_app_bar.dart
    (ItemDetailAppBar._action): iconSize 20 → 18, VisualDensity.compact,
    padding 8 → 4; same for the overflow PopupMenuButton.
  * lib/shared/widgets/filter_subfilter_bar.dart (_SubfilterBarState.build):
    Bottom padding 8 → 4.

- **TMDB content language list expanded from 3 to 45 locales**

  The content language picker now covers TMDB's primary translations
  (sorted by code, named in their own language), with Chinese split into
  Simplified and Traditional. On first run the welcome wizard also
  derives the AniList title mode from the chosen content language
  (English → english, Japanese → native, otherwise romaji).

  * lib/shared/constants/tmdb_content_languages.dart
    (kTmdbContentLanguages, anilistTitleLanguageForContent): Expanded
    list; new content-to-AniList mapping.
  * lib/features/welcome/widgets/welcome_step_language.dart
    (_WelcomeStepLanguageState._applyContentLanguage): Apply both TMDB
    and AniList title language on first-run selection.

- **Gamepad debug log export goes through the system save dialog**

  On Android the log was silently written into the app documents folder;
  now every platform shows a save dialog (SAF on Android) so the user
  picks the destination.

  * lib/features/settings/screens/gamepad_debug_screen.dart
    (_GamepadDebugScreenState._exportLog): Unified FilePicker.saveFile
    path with bytes payload; manual write kept for desktop.

- **Localization strings deduplicated: 262 duplicate keys collapsed**

  Of ~1740 keys in `app_en.arb`, 452 were value-duplicates across 161
  groups — mostly per-import-source copies of "Select collection",
  "Target collection", "Create new collection" and the like. They are
  now shared keys (generic `import*` family plus bare vocabulary keys:
  `all`, `name`, `title`, `status`, `date`, `rating`, `sort`, …), so
  every new language translates each string once. 26 groups (55 keys)
  are kept apart on purpose — same English, different translation by
  context (grammatical gender in statuses, anime formats in Chinese,
  "Title" as heading vs. ScreenScraper media type, unit vs. label
  wordings).

  Deliberate translation unifications along the way: the wishlist is
  «Желаемое» everywhere (was also «Вишлист»/«Список желаний»), AniList
  import shares the common import wording, `{count} imported/updated`
  use proper Russian plurals everywhere, and the IGDB-required hint
  points at the section's real Russian name («Учётные данные»).

  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb, lib/l10n/app_zh.arb:
    262 keys removed, ~40 shared keys added; en/ru/zh key sets are now
    identical.
  * lib/l10n/app_localizations.dart, app_localizations_en.dart,
    app_localizations_ru.dart, app_localizations_zh.dart: Regenerated.
  * 121 files across lib/ and test/: references rewritten to the shared
    keys.
  * test/l10n/arb_parity_test.dart: New — guards that every locale file
    keeps exactly the template key set with matching placeholders.

- **MyAnimeList "On-Hold" now imports as Dropped**

  The local Dropped status doubles as "paused" (pause icon), which is how
  AniList Paused and Hardcover Paused already import. MAL On-Hold used to
  land in Planned; it now aligns with the other importers.

  * lib/core/import/sources/mal/mal_import_service.dart (MalImportService._mapStatus):
    `on-hold` → dropped.

- **Batch item insert keeps a source-provided add date**

  Import sources can now carry the original "added" date of an item
  (Hardcover uses this for its date_added); rows without one still get
  the current time.

  * lib/core/database/dao/collection_dao.dart (CollectionDao.addItemsBatch):
    Use the row's `added_at` when present instead of always stamping now.

- **Search source menu no longer cuts off the lower groups**

  The source dropdown capped at 400px, hiding Books, VNDB and ComicVine
  behind an invisible scroll. It now grows up to 75% of the screen, and
  when the list still doesn't fit, carousel-style up/down arrows appear at
  the menu edges from the moment it opens (the stock popup gave no scroll
  hint until the pointer hovered it); the arrows page-scroll on click.

  * lib/shared/widgets/chevron_filter_bar.dart (DropdownChevronSegment,
    showArrowedMenu): Replace the stock PopupMenuButton popup with a custom
    anchored menu route that shows scroll-arrow indicators.

- **Tag resolve-or-create consolidated into one DAO batch method**

  Four copies of the "find tag by name or create it" logic (DAO, backup
  restore, two import services) now share a single snapshot-based batch
  resolver; backup restore no longer rescans the tag table per tag (was
  O(n²)).

  * lib/core/database/dao/global_tag_dao.dart (GlobalTagDao.resolveOrCreateAll,
    GlobalTagDao.nameKey, TagSeed): New batch resolver over one getAll snapshot;
    resolveOrCreate delegates to it.
  * lib/core/services/backup_service.dart (BackupService._restoreTags),
    lib/core/services/import_service.dart (ImportService._importTags),
    lib/core/import/sources/custom_file/custom_cards_import_service.dart
    (CustomCardsImportService._applyTags): Use resolveOrCreateAll.

- **Performance: fewer redundant queries and rescans on hot paths**

  * lib/core/database/dao/collection_dao.dart
    (CollectionDao.addItemsBatchReturningIds),
    lib/data/repositories/collection_repository.dart
    (CollectionRepository.addItemsBatchReturningIds): New — bulk insert that
    returns per-row ids, so custom-cards import tags freshly written rows
    directly instead of rescanning the whole collection.
  * lib/features/home/providers/all_items_provider.dart (allTagsMapProvider):
    Derived from globalTagsProvider instead of a second tag-table query on
    the All Items screen.
  * lib/shared/widgets/media_detail_view.dart
    (_MediaDetailViewState._resolveCardLinks): Card-link lookups run in
    parallel via Future.wait instead of sequential awaits.
  * lib/shared/widgets/card_link_picker.dart (_CardLinkPickerSheetState):
    250ms input debounce, precomputed lowercase names and an early exit at
    50 matches instead of a full library rescan per keystroke.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/copy_as_text_dialog.dart
    (_CopyAsTextDialogState._preview, _CopyAsTextDialogState.build): Preview
    computed once per build and tag names resolved only for the 5 preview
    rows while typing.

- **God-file split: collection table and media detail view**

  Pure refactor, no behaviour change: collection_table_view.dart went from
  834 to ~400 lines, media_detail_view.dart from 1344 to ~640.

  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_table/table_fields.dart
    (TableFields, tableColumnLabels), table_columns.dart
    (buildCollectionTableColumns), table_rows.dart (buildCollectionTableRows),
    table_toolbar.dart (TableToolbar): New — extracted from
    collection_table_view.dart (CollectionTableView keeps its public API).
  * lib/shared/widgets/media_detail/ (MediaDetailBackdrop, MediaCoverImage,
    IdentityHeader, ExpandableDescription, ProgressTile, ProgressTileGrid,
    SystemMetaInfoButton, UserRatingSection, CommentSectionHeader,
    CommentContainer, TrackerCommentsLayout, MediaDetailChip): New —
    extracted from media_detail_view.dart (MediaDetailView keeps its
    public API; MediaDetailChip is re-exported).
  * lib/shared/utils/url_launch.dart (launchExternalUrl): New shared
    best-effort launcher.
  * lib/shared/widgets/mini_markdown_text.dart (_MiniMarkdownTextState),
    lib/features/settings/content/credits_content.dart,
    lib/features/search/widgets/item_details_sheet.dart,
    lib/features/collections/widgets/canvas_link_item.dart
    (CanvasLinkItem._openUrl): Replace private URL-launcher copies with
    launchExternalUrl.

### Fixed

- **External links restricted to http/https schemes**

  `launchExternalUrl`, the shared entry point for opening links from
  notes, imports and API data, now refuses non-web schemes so a
  malformed or malicious link can't launch `file://` or a custom-scheme
  handler.

  * lib/shared/utils/url_launch.dart (launchExternalUrl): Allowlist
    http/https before launching.

- **Mobile keyboard no longer pops up unprompted**

  On phones the on-screen keyboard used to appear the moment the tag
  picker, rename-tag dialog, or the Personalization view opened, covering
  half the screen before any tap. The two tag dialogs now autofocus only
  on desktop, and opening Personalization drops focus from and disables
  the shared top-bar search field (which has no meaning there). Desktop
  keeps its type-immediately behaviour.

  * lib/features/collections/widgets/tag_picker_dialog.dart
    (_TagPickerDialogState.build),
    lib/features/collections/widgets/tag_management_dialog.dart
    (_RenameTagDialogState.build): Gate the search / rename field
    `autofocus` behind `!kIsMobile`.
  * lib/shared/navigation/app_top_bar.dart (AppTopBar.suppressSearch,
    _AppTopBarState.build): New flag; when set, the search context is
    null so the field renders disabled.
  * lib/shared/navigation/app_shell.dart (_AppShellState._buildScaffold,
    _AppShellState._openPreferenceCloud): Pass suppressSearch while
    Personalization is open and unfocus the primary focus on open.

- **Platform and format sub-filters now combine instead of hiding everything**

  Selecting a game platform together with an anime/manga format (e.g. NES
  + OVA) used to intersect the two groups and return an empty list. Active
  sub-filter groups now unite, each scoped to its own kind of item: NES
  games and OVA anime show side by side. Applies to both the collection
  screen and All Items.

  * lib/shared/utils/media_format.dart (MediaFormat.matchesSubfilters):
    Replaces matchesFormatFilter — single OR predicate over platform +
    format groups.
  * lib/features/collections/helpers/collection_filters.dart
    (CollectionFilters.apply), lib/features/home/screens/all_items_screen.dart
    (_AllItemsScreenState): One combined subfilter pass instead of two
    intersecting ones.


- **Hardcover token now syncs between devices and counts in Settings**

  The config export / LAN sync / backup key list and the Settings "API
  Keys" counter both predate the Hardcover source: the token (and the
  remembered import username) stayed on one device, and the counter said
  6/6 with Hardcover configured. Both now include it (counter is N/7).

  * lib/core/services/config_service.dart (ConfigService._settingsKeys):
    Add hardcoverApiKey and hardcoverUsername.
  * lib/features/settings/screens/settings_screen.dart (_apiKeyStates):
    Count the Hardcover key.

- **Device-to-device sync no longer crashes when the network is down**

  Opening the LAN sync screen with no usable network (airplane mode,
  Wi-Fi off) threw an unhandled SocketException from the HTTP server
  bind; the screen now shows an error message instead.

  * lib/features/settings/screens/lan_sync_screen.dart
    (_LanSyncScreenState._start): Wrap LanSyncService.start in try/catch
    and surface the failure as a snack.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb, lib/l10n/app_zh.arb
    (lanSyncStartError): New key.

- **"Copy as text" fills {tags} with the user's tags for every media type**

  The {tags} token only ever emitted AniList/MangaBaka source tags for
  anime and manga; user-assigned global tags were ignored entirely. It now
  means exactly the user's own tags (in tag display order) for all types;
  source-provided tag lists are no longer used.

  * lib/core/services/text_export_service.dart (TextExportService.applyTemplate,
    TextExportService.formatItem): Accept a caller-resolved item-id →
    tag-names map; drop the anime/manga source-tag fallback.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/copy_as_text_dialog.dart
    (_CopyAsTextDialogState._tagsByItemId): Resolve the map from
    itemTagsProvider + globalTagsProvider.

- **All Items group headers no longer overflow on narrow screens**

  A collection header (underlined name + per-type tallies) wider than the
  screen threw a RenderFlex overflow on phones; the name now ellipsizes
  and the tallies wrap to the next line.

  * lib/features/home/screens/all_items_screen.dart
    (_AllItemsScreenState._buildCollectionDivider,
    _AllItemsScreenState._headerInfo): Row → Wrap; each tally is one
    self-contained chip so it never splits across lines.

- **Row drag-to-reorder in the table view now works on touch screens**

  trina_grid's built-in drag handle starts the drag on the first pointer
  move, which on a phone loses the gesture to the grid's vertical scroll —
  the list scrolled and the row never moved. The handle is now a custom
  widget: on touch platforms the drag starts after a short hold (like
  ReorderableListView), on desktop the immediate mouse drag stays.

  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_table/row_drag_handle.dart
    (RowDragHandle): New — LongPressDraggable on touch platforms, Draggable
    on desktop; drives trina_grid's drag state and auto-scroll.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_table/table_columns.dart
    (buildCollectionTableColumns): Drag column renders RowDragHandle
    instead of enableRowDrag.

- **Table filter dialog no longer crashes the table view**

  Opening the Filters dialog in the collection table view threw a render
  error (a LayoutBuilder inside the dialog cannot answer the intrinsic
  width AlertDialog asks for) and left the whole screen broken until it
  was rebuilt.

  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_table/table_filter.dart
    (_TableFilterDialogState.build): Compute the content width from
    MediaQuery directly instead of a LayoutBuilder.

- **Broken card-link tokens no longer point at the wrong item**

  A `[[card:mt=bogus;id=5]]` token silently parsed as a game link (unknown
  media type fell back to game) and could resolve to an unrelated card;
  unknown types now make the token unparseable, so it renders as plain text.

  * lib/shared/models/media_type.dart (MediaType.tryFromString): New —
    null on unrecognised input; fromString delegates to it.
  * lib/shared/models/card_link.dart (parseCardLink): Return null for an
    unknown `mt` instead of defaulting to game.

## [0.38.2] - 2026-07-12

### Changed

- **Smaller Android downloads**

  The Android app is now also built as per-architecture (ABI) APKs, so each
  download is roughly a third of the universal APK size. The universal APK
  remains available for direct download.

  * .github/workflows/release.yml (build-android, create-release): Run a
    second `flutter build apk --split-per-abi` alongside the universal build
    and publish the arm64-v8a, armeabi-v7a and x86_64 APKs to the release.

## [0.38.1] - 2026-07-12

### Added

- **Simplified Chinese (zh) interface localization**

  The app interface is now available in Simplified Chinese alongside
  English and Russian. The language and welcome pickers offer 中文, and
  selecting it defaults TMDB content language to `zh-CN`. Contributed by
  @sqliu07 (#350).

  * lib/l10n/app_zh.arb, lib/l10n/app_localizations_zh.dart (SZh): New —
    full zh translation (all 1709 keys) and its generated delegate.
  * lib/l10n/app_localizations.dart (S.supportedLocales, _SDelegate.isSupported,
    lookupS): Register the `zh` locale.
  * lib/features/settings/screens/settings_screen.dart (_SettingsScreenState):
    Add 中文 to the app-language picker and selected-value label.
  * lib/features/welcome/widgets/welcome_step_language.dart
    (_WelcomeStepLanguageState): Add the 中文 option; reindex WelcomeReveal.
  * lib/shared/constants/tmdb_content_languages.dart (kTmdbContentLanguages,
    _kUiToContentLanguage): Add `zh-CN` and the `zh` → `zh-CN` mapping.
  * test/features/welcome/widgets/welcome_step_language_test.dart: Cover the
    three-language picker and Chinese selection.

## [0.38.0] - 2026-07-10

### Added

- **macOS support (experimental)**

  Tonkatsu Box now builds and runs on macOS, joining Windows, Linux and
  Android. The macOS target mirrors the Linux feature set: no VGMaps
  browser and no screenshot capture (both Windows-only), while
  collections, visual boards, import, Kodi sync, gamepads and Discord
  Rich Presence are available. The App Sandbox is disabled so Discord RPC
  can reach its IPC socket. The release pipeline now produces an unsigned
  `.dmg`. macOS support is experimental and not yet tested by the
  maintainers; the unsigned build triggers a Gatekeeper warning on first
  launch. Contributed by @eugenekv (#341).

  * macos/ (Runner Xcode project, Info.plist, AppInfo.xcconfig,
    AppDelegate, MainFlutterWindow, app icons): New — macOS platform
    scaffolding. App Sandbox disabled in DebugProfile.entitlements and
    Release.entitlements so Discord RPC works.
  * .github/workflows/release.yml (build-macos, create-release): New job
    runs `flutter build macos`, packages a `.dmg` via hdiutil, and
    uploads it as a release artifact.
  * pubspec.yaml (flutter_launcher_icons): Enable macOS launcher-icon
    generation.
  * README.md, docs/index.html: List macOS across the platform table,
    download links, badges and landing page; note the experimental and
    untested status.

- **Cross-links between cards in notes**

  Notes can now link to another card with a `[[card:…|name]]` token. Typing
  `[[` in a note opens a search-and-insert picker over every collection;
  picking a card inserts the token. In view mode the token renders as an
  inline chip (cover, source, release year and — for games — the platform),
  and tapping it opens the target card; when several cards match, a small
  sheet asks which collection to open, and an unresolved link stays as plain
  inactive text. Item menus (detail screen, collection grid, All items) gain
  a "Copy card link" action. Links are content-based (source + external id,
  plus platform for games), so they survive export/import into another
  database instead of breaking on reused row ids.

  * lib/shared/models/card_link.dart (CardLinkRef, buildCardLinkToken,
    parseCardLink, extractCardLinks, cardSubcategoryLabel,
    sanitizeCardLinkDisplay, cardLinkTokenPattern): New — token model,
    build/parse/extract, media subcategory label.
  * lib/shared/widgets/card_link_chip.dart (CardLinkChip): New — inline chip
    for a resolved link.
  * lib/shared/widgets/card_link_picker.dart (showCardLinkPicker): New —
    lazy search bottom sheet (results only while typing, capped at 50).
  * lib/shared/widgets/mini_markdown_text.dart (MiniMarkdownText): Render
    `[[card:…]]` tokens as chips via new `resolvedLinks` map and `onCardLink`
    callback; unresolved tokens fall back to inactive text.
  * lib/shared/widgets/media_detail_view.dart (MediaDetailView,
    _MediaDetailViewState): Pre-resolve note tokens for synchronous chip
    rendering, `[[` autocomplete in the notes editor, `onCardLinkTap`.
  * lib/shared/widgets/markdown_toolbar.dart (MarkdownToolbar): Optional
    insert-card-link button.
  * lib/core/database/dao/collection_dao.dart (CollectionDao.resolveCardLink),
    lib/core/database/database_service.dart (DatabaseService.resolveCardLink):
    Content-based resolve, preferring the hinted collection then falling back
    across all collections.
  * lib/features/collections/screens/item_detail_screen.dart
    (_ItemDetailScreenState._openCardLink,
    _ItemDetailScreenState._pickCardLinkTarget): Resolve a tapped link and
    open the target, with a picker on multiple matches.
  * lib/features/collections/helpers/collection_actions.dart
    (CollectionActions.copyItemLink): New shared copy-link action.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/item_detail/item_detail_app_bar.dart
    (ItemDetailMenuAction.copyLink),
    lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_items_view.dart,
    lib/features/home/screens/all_items_screen.dart: "Copy card link" menu
    entry.

- **Custom-card import from JSON/CSV files**

  A new import source (Settings → Import → Custom cards) for loading cards
  produced by the user's own scripts or parsers. One file per run: JSON (an
  array of objects, or a single object) or CSV (RFC 4180, header-addressed
  columns). Only `title` and `type` are required; the schema covers every
  card field (alt title, description, year, genres, link, cover URL,
  platform, manga/anime format, unit totals) and every personal field
  (status, rating, note, rewatch counter, start/finish dates, time spent,
  favorite, episode/season progress, global tags — missing tags are created
  automatically). The file is parsed and validated up front without touching
  the database; a preview screen shows "Recognized N · Errors M ·
  Duplicates K" with a lazy checkbox list — invalid rows float to the top
  with their reasons, duplicates (same title already in the target
  collection, or repeated in the file) are unchecked by default. Covers
  (http/https only) are downloaded into the image cache only after
  confirmation and only for the imported rows. Two downloadable templates
  document the format: a header-only CSV and a self-describing JSON whose
  `_`-prefixed hint keys the parser ignores, so the template itself imports
  cleanly. Platform text is matched against the platform catalog
  case-insensitively (abbreviation or full name); unmatched text is kept as
  a free-form platform name.

  * lib/core/import/sources/custom_file/custom_card_entry.dart
    (CustomCardFields, CustomCardEntry, CustomCardRow, CustomCardIssue,
    CustomCardIssueCode, CustomCardsParseException,
    CustomCardsParseErrorCode): New — schema constants, parsed-entry model,
    per-row validation issues, whole-file parse errors.
  * lib/core/import/sources/custom_file/custom_cards_parser.dart
    (CustomCardsParser.parseBytes, CustomCardsParser.parseJson,
    CustomCardsParser.parseCsv): New — format sniffing, UTF-8 BOM handling,
    quote-aware CSV splitting over code units, full field validation.
  * lib/core/import/sources/custom_file/custom_cards_template.dart
    (CustomCardsTemplate.csv, CustomCardsTemplate.json): New — downloadable
    templates.
  * lib/core/import/sources/custom_file/custom_cards_import_service.dart
    (CustomCardsImportService.parseFile,
    CustomCardsImportService.duplicateRowIndexes,
    CustomCardsImportService.importSelected,
    customCardsImportServiceProvider): New — preview-driven two-phase
    import: batch card creation, platform catalog matching, explicit dates
    overriding status-derived ones, tag resolve-or-create and assignment,
    post-import cover downloads with per-card failure notes.
  * lib/core/database/dao/custom_media_dao.dart (CustomMediaDao.createAll):
    New batch insert returning the new row ids in order.
  * lib/features/settings/content/custom_cards_import_content.dart
    (CustomCardsImportContent, localizedParseError): New — file pick,
    template download buttons, target collection choice.
  * lib/features/settings/screens/custom_cards_import_screen.dart
    (CustomCardsImportScreen): New — title-bar wrapper.
  * lib/features/settings/screens/custom_cards_preview_screen.dart
    (CustomCardsPreviewScreen): New — summary, select all/none, lazy
    checkbox list with problem rows first, import progress dialog.
  * lib/features/settings/screens/settings_screen.dart: Custom cards tile
    in the Import group.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb: customImport* /
    settingsCustomCardsImport* keys.

- **Replay status and a rewatch counter**

  A sixth item status for going through a finished title again: Replaying
  for games and visual novels, Rewatching for movies / TV / anime,
  Rereading for manga and books («Повтор» in filters and tables). Switching
  to it never touches the started/completed dates — the item stays
  completed-once. Alongside it, every item gets a rewatch counter with
  MAL/AniList semantics: empty = not tracked, 0 = completed once, N = number
  of repeats. Any transition into Completed bumps it automatically (first
  completion writes 0), and it is editable by hand from the item card chip
  next to the time-spent timer. AniList imports map REPEATING to the new
  status and store `repeat` in the counter; MAL imports store
  `my_times_watched` / `my_times_read`; both keep the old comment line too.
  The counter round-trips through .xcoll/.xcollx exports and backups; files
  saved before this version import as "not tracked".

  * lib/shared/models/item_status.dart (ItemStatus.replaying,
    ItemStatus.localizedLabel, ItemStatus.genericLabel,
    ItemStatus.statusSortPriority): New enum value; media-type labels;
    sorts right after In Progress.
  * lib/shared/models/item_status_logic.dart (computeDatesForStatus,
    computeRewatchCountForStatus, _externalStatusPriority): Replaying keeps
    both dates; new pure counter rule (null → 0, else +1, only on
    transitions into completed); external-merge priority above completed.
  * lib/shared/models/collection_item.dart (CollectionItem.rewatchCount,
    CollectionItem.fromDbWithJoins, CollectionItem.fromExport,
    CollectionItem.toDb, CollectionItem.toExport, CollectionItem.copyWith,
    CollectionItem.withStatus): New nullable field with full round-trip;
    withStatus applies the counter rule.
  * lib/core/database/migrations/migration_v55.dart (MigrationV55): New —
    nullable `collection_items.rewatch_count`.
  * lib/core/database/migrations/migration_registry.dart
    (MigrationRegistry.all), lib/core/database/database_service.dart
    (DatabaseService._initDatabase, DatabaseService.updateItemRewatchCount):
    Register v55, bump version to 55, DAO passthrough.
  * lib/core/database/dao/collection_dao.dart (CollectionDao.updateItemStatus,
    CollectionDao.updateItemRewatchCount, CollectionDao.getCollectionItemStats):
    Status write bumps the counter via computeRewatchCountForStatus and
    leaves dates alone for replaying; verbatim counter setter; replaying
    bucket in stats.
  * lib/data/repositories/collection_repository.dart (CollectionStats.replaying,
    CollectionRepository.updateItemRewatchCount, CollectionRepository.getStats):
    New stats bucket (not counted into completionPercent) and setter.
  * lib/features/collections/providers/collections_provider.dart
    (CollectionItemsNotifier.setRewatchCount,
    CollectionItemsNotifier.updateActivityDates): Manual counter editing;
    date-picker completion patches the counter locally.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/dialogs/rewatch_count_dialog.dart
    (RewatchCountDialog): New — numeric editor, empty field clears back to
    "not tracked".
  * lib/shared/widgets/media_detail_view.dart (MediaDetailView.rewatchCount,
    MediaDetailView.onRewatchCountTap, _buildStatChip): Counter chip next to
    the time-spent chip; both now share one chip builder.
  * lib/features/collections/screens/item_detail_screen.dart
    (_showRewatchCountDialog): Wires the chip to the dialog and provider.
  * lib/core/import/import_columns.dart (repeatIsTracked): Shared rule for
    when a source repeat value is worth storing.
  * lib/core/import/sources/anilist/anilist_import_service.dart
    (AniListImportService._mapStatus, AniListImportService._insertRow,
    AniListImportService._changedFields): REPEATING → replaying; `repeat`
    into `rewatch_count` on insert and overwrite re-import.
  * lib/core/import/sources/mal/mal_import_service.dart
    (MalImportService._insertRow, MalImportService._changedFields,
    MalImportService._statusLabel): `timesWatched` into `rewatch_count`;
    label for the new status.
  * lib/core/services/import_service.dart (ImportService._restoreUserData,
    ImportService._hasUserData): Restores the file's counter after the
    status write so the file value wins; never wipes a local counter with
    null.
  * lib/core/services/text_export_service.dart (_statusLabel),
    lib/shared/widgets/chevron_filter_bar.dart (_order): "Replay" label and
    filter entry.
  * lib/shared/theme/app_colors.dart (AppColors.statusReplaying): New color.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb (statusReplay, statusReplaying,
    statusRewatching, statusRereading, rewatchCountEdit, rewatchCountHint):
    New keys.

### Changed

- **Localize the keyboard-shortcut help (F1)**

  The F1 legend and its dialog now follow the interface language instead of
  always showing Russian. Shortcut groups moved from `static const` fields to
  builders that take the localizations object; key combos (Ctrl+N, F5, …) stay
  literal.

  * lib/shared/keyboard/keyboard_shortcuts.dart (globalShortcutGroup),
    lib/shared/keyboard/keyboard_shortcuts_dialog.dart (KeyboardShortcutsDialog):
    Resolve titles/descriptions and dialog chrome via `S`.
  * lib/features/collections/screens/home_screen.dart (HomeScreen.shortcutGroup),
    lib/features/collections/screens/collection_screen.dart (CollectionScreen.shortcutGroup),
    lib/features/collections/screens/item_detail_screen.dart (ItemDetailScreen.shortcutGroup),
    lib/features/tier_lists/screens/tier_lists_screen.dart (TierListsScreen.shortcutGroup),
    lib/features/tier_lists/screens/tier_list_detail_screen.dart (TierListDetailScreen.shortcutGroup),
    lib/features/wishlist/screens/wishlist_screen.dart (WishlistScreen.shortcutGroup),
    lib/features/search/screens/search_screen.dart (SearchScreen.shortcutGroup):
    `shortcutGroup` is now a builder taking `S`.
  * lib/shared/navigation/app_shell.dart (_AppShellState._currentScreenShortcutGroups):
    Pass the localizations object when building the groups.

- **Collection table view rebuilt on the trina_grid package**

  The hand-rolled table is replaced with a grid that supports dragging and
  resizing columns, hiding columns, per-column sorting and multi-rule
  filtering, all styled to match the app's dark theme. Column order, widths
  and hidden columns persist per collection. A single "Filters" button opens
  a rule editor (column + condition + value, combined with AND; status picks
  from a dropdown of real statuses, other columns use text conditions like
  "contains"); a "Columns" button toggles visibility. Manual sort mode gets
  a dedicated left-frozen drag-handle column so reordering rows works on
  touch. Inline editing (rating stars, status, favorite, tags), row
  selection with select-all, right-click context menu and manual reorder are
  preserved; opening an item is now a single tap on its name or a double tap
  on the row. On narrow screens the filter dialog stacks each rule
  vertically so its controls stay readable.

  * pubspec.yaml, pubspec.lock: Add `trina_grid` and its transitive
    `shadcn_ui` (promoted to a direct dependency — the grid's popups need
    `ShadTheme` in context).
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_table/collection_table_view.dart
    (CollectionTableView): Rewritten over `TrinaGrid` — column builders with
    our cell renderers, row build/reload, sort/filter/selection/reorder
    wiring, per-collection layout persistence, a scoped rounded checkbox
    theme, and a `_skipNextReload` guard so a grid-initiated row drag isn't
    torn down mid-gesture on touch.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_table/table_filter.dart
    (TableFilterCondition, TableFilterRule, TableFilterDialog): New — filter
    model and the responsive rule-editor dialog.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_table/table_style.dart
    (collectionTableConfiguration): New — dark `TrinaGridConfiguration`.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_table/table_layout_store.dart
    (TableColumnLayout, TableLayoutStore): New — per-collection column layout
    (order, widths, hidden) in SharedPreferences.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_table/cells/name_cell.dart
    (NameCell): New — name + genres cell extracted from the view.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_table/table_column.dart,
    table_header.dart, table_row.dart: Removed — superseded by the grid.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_items_view.dart
    (CollectionItemsView): Pass `collectionId` to the table for layout
    persistence.

- **Item detail card regrouped, with an animated status switcher**

  The detail card no longer crams everything beside the cover: the header
  keeps only short identity facts, the description spans full width with an
  "More…/Collapse" toggle, tags sit below it, and user-set progress (started
  / completed dates, time spent, rewatch count) becomes a symmetric tile row
  (2×2 on narrow widths). System metadata (added / last activity dates,
  auto-computed completion time) moved behind an info button. The status
  switcher's highlight now slides between segments while its color morphs
  from the old status color to the new one. Long joined info chips (genres,
  studios, tags) expand on tap to show the full text. The translucent
  backing now stretches edge to edge so narrow screens don't lose width to a
  doubled-up margin.

  * lib/shared/widgets/media_detail_view.dart (MediaDetailView,
    _InfoChip, _ExpandableDescription): Regrouped layout, expandable
    description and info chips, progress tiles, system-metadata info button.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/status_chip_row.dart (StatusChipRow,
    _StatusSegment): Sliding, color-morphing selection highlight built with
    `AnimatedAlign` + `FractionallySizedBox` (keeps intrinsic sizes so popup
    menus still measure it).
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb (showMore, showLess): New keys
    for the description toggle.

- **Compacter, on-theme dialogs**

  Dialog titles use the app's 18px heading instead of Material's 24px, and
  action rows are tighter. The tag manager, tag picker and rename dialogs
  lost their doubled padding and second-line usage counts; the date picker
  no longer overflows when the window is squeezed narrow. The rename-tag
  dialog owns its text controller so it no longer throws "used after
  disposed" while the dialog animates closed.

  * lib/shared/theme/app_theme.dart (AppTheme.darkTheme): `dialogTheme`
    gains title/content text styles and tighter `actionsPadding`.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/tag_management_dialog.dart
    (TagManagementDialog, _RenameTagDialog, _TagRow): Compact padding,
    inline usage count, controller owned by a stateful rename dialog.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/tag_picker_dialog.dart (TagPickerDialog):
    Compact padding and dense rows.
  * lib/shared/widgets/dual_date_picker_dialog.dart (DualDatePickerDialog):
    Responsive side-by-side/stacked body via `LayoutBuilder`; use
    `kIsMobile`.

- **Collection section headers on the All Items screen**

  Each collection group on the All Items (Home) grid is now headed by the
  collection name with a thick accent underline, its total count, per-type
  tallies (a media-type icon with the number of items of that type) and a
  favourites count. Uncategorized uses a muted grey accent.

  * lib/features/home/screens/all_items_screen.dart
    (_AllItemsScreenState._buildCollectionDivider,
    _AllItemsScreenState._headerInfo): Replace the centered thin-line
    divider with the underlined header and per-type info cluster.

- **Centered subcategory filter chips**

  Subcategory chips (game platforms, manga/anime formats) center within the
  strip when they fit and still scroll when they overflow, instead of
  hugging the left edge.

  * lib/shared/widgets/filter_subfilter_bar.dart (SubfilterBar): Center the
    chip row via a `ConstrainedBox` min-width so `MainAxisAlignment.center`
    has room, keeping horizontal scroll on overflow.

- **Tags are now global and an item can carry several of them**

  Tags moved from per-collection lists to one app-wide set shared by all
  collections; existing tags are merged by name (case-insensitive, Cyrillic
  aware) with links preserved. An item can now hold any number of tags: the
  detail card, grid badge (first tag plus a "+N" counter), table cell and a
  new multi-select picker with inline quick-create all work over the shared
  set. Tags gained an optional label text color for cases where the
  auto-white text is unreadable on the background color. The tag filter is
  include-only OR — selected tags show every item carrying any of them.
  Moving an item between collections keeps its tags; copying duplicates the
  links. Exports write a `tag_names` array per item (plus the legacy
  `tag_name` so older app versions still restore one tag), imports accept
  both formats, and full backups add a `tags.json` with the complete global
  set. A global tag manager (create / rename / both colors / drag reorder /
  usage counts / delete) opens from the collections screen menu and from a
  collection.

  * lib/core/database/migrations/migration_v54.dart (MigrationV54): New
    `tags` (with `text_color`) + `item_tags` junction; merges
    `collection_tags` case-insensitively, most-used tag donates name casing
    and color, links copied into the junction; legacy structures untouched.
  * lib/core/database/migrations/migration_registry.dart (MigrationRegistry.all),
    lib/core/database/database_service.dart (DatabaseService._initDatabase,
    DatabaseService.globalTagDao, globalTagDaoProvider,
    DatabaseService.clearAllData): Register v54, bump version to 54, wire the
    DAO, truncate `tags`/`item_tags` on clear; legacy `TagDao` wiring removed.
  * lib/shared/models/tag.dart (Tag, Tag.findByNameCaseInsensitive,
    TagListProjection.orderedFor, TagListProjection.primaryFor): New global
    model with `textColor` and shared display-order projections.
  * lib/core/database/dao/global_tag_dao.dart (GlobalTagDao): New — CRUD,
    resolveOrCreate, setItemTags, getTagIdsByItem, getTagIdsForItems
    (chunked), getAllItemTags, setSortOrders, upsertAll.
  * lib/features/collections/providers/global_tags_provider.dart
    (globalTagsProvider, GlobalTagsNotifier),
    lib/features/collections/providers/item_tags_provider.dart
    (itemTagsProvider, ItemTagsNotifier): New state layer — tag list with
    CRUD/reorder and the whole-DB item→tag-ids map.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/tag_picker_dialog.dart (TagPickerDialog):
    New multi-select picker with inline tag creation.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/tag_management_dialog.dart
    (TagManagementDialog): Global manager — text color dot, drag reorder,
    usage counts; no longer takes a collection id.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/item_tags_section.dart (ItemTagsSection):
    Multi-chip section over the global set; opens the picker.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_items_view.dart
    (CollectionItemsView): `itemTags` map prop, primary-tag grouping, "Tags"
    context-menu entry, picker-based tag editing.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_table/collection_table_view.dart
    (CollectionTableView), table_row.dart (TableRow), table_header.dart
    (TableHeader), cells/tag_cell.dart (TagCell): Multi-tag chips in the tag
    column, cycle filter understands multi-tags and "untagged", sort by
    primary tag, `onTagsEdit` callback.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/tag_sidebar.dart (TagSidebar),
    collection_filter_bar.dart (CollectionFilterBar),
    collection_filter_sheet.dart (CollectionFilterSheet): Work over `Tag`.
  * lib/features/collections/helpers/collection_filters.dart
    (CollectionFilters.apply): Filters and text search read the item→tags
    map; OR semantics over selected tag ids.
  * lib/features/collections/helpers/bulk_operations.dart (BulkOperations),
    lib/features/collections/helpers/collection_actions.dart
    (CollectionActions.moveItem, CollectionActions.cloneItem),
    lib/features/collections/providers/collections_provider.dart
    (CollectionItemsNotifier.cloneItem, CollectionItemsNotifier.moveItem):
    Move keeps tags implicitly, clone copies the links; per-collection tag
    remap logic removed.
  * lib/features/collections/screens/collection_screen.dart
    (_CollectionScreenState._visibleTags): Filters show only tags used by the
    collection's items; single computation per build.
  * lib/features/collections/screens/home_screen.dart (HomeScreen): Tag
    manager entry in the collections FAB menu.
  * lib/features/home/providers/all_items_provider.dart (allTagsMapProvider),
    lib/features/home/screens/all_items_screen.dart (AllItemsScreen): Global
    tag map, multi-tag search match, primary tag + "+N" on cards.
  * lib/shared/widgets/media_poster_card.dart (MediaPosterCard.tagTextColor,
    MediaPosterCard.tagMoreCount, _TagBadge): Label text color and "+N".
  * lib/core/services/export_service.dart (ExportService._collectTagData):
    Exports the global tags used by the collection and per-item `tag_names`.
  * lib/core/services/import_service.dart (ImportService._importTags):
    Resolves names into the global set, accepts `tag_names` and legacy
    `tag_name`, writes links via setItemTags.
  * lib/core/services/backup_service.dart (BackupService.createBackup,
    BackupService._restoreTags): `tags.json` in full backups, restored before
    collections.
  * lib/shared/models/collection_tag.dart (CollectionTag),
    lib/core/database/dao/tag_dao.dart (TagDao),
    lib/features/collections/providers/collection_tags_provider.dart
    (collectionTagsProvider): Removed — superseded by the global stack.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb (tagPickerTitle, tagTextColor):
    New keys.

### Fixed

- **Windows crash in gamepads_windows_plugin.dll on USB connect/disconnect**

  The gamepads plugin's native Windows DLL listens to device changes even
  though the app never subscribes to gamepad input on Windows, and its
  listener crashes the app (0xc0000005) when a non-gamepad USB device is
  plugged or unplugged. The Windows implementation is now replaced with a
  local Dart-only stub via `dependency_overrides`, so the DLL is not built or
  shipped at all. Android keeps the real implementation.

  * packages/gamepads_windows_stub/pubspec.yaml,
    packages/gamepads_windows_stub/lib/gamepads_windows.dart: New stub
    package named `gamepads_windows` with no native plugin declaration.
  * pubspec.yaml (dependency_overrides): Point `gamepads_windows` at the stub.

## [0.37.0] - 2026-07-05

### Added

- **Likes and notes on individual title units (episodes, seasons, chapters…)**

  A universal per-unit mark: a like and/or a free-text note attached to a
  single unit inside a collection item, stored separately from watch/read
  progress. Marks anchor on `collection_items.id` (not the TMDB show id), so
  the feature works for every media type and cascades away with the item. For
  media with a ready-made unit list (TV / animation from TMDB) the like-heart
  and note button sit inline on each episode tile and season header, with a
  summary + filter bar (All / Liked / With notes) above the season list. For
  media without one (anime, manga, custom…) an "add mark" form lets the user
  pick a unit type (episode / season / chapter / volume / page / part or a
  custom string) and number, below a list of the marks they created. Marks are
  carried in `.xcoll` / `.xcollx` user-data exports and re-anchored to the new
  item id on import. Episodes already cached in the DB are loaded up front so
  the summary and filter work without extra TMDB requests.

  * lib/shared/models/item_mark.dart (ItemMark, kUnitEpisode/kUnitSeason/…,
    unitCoordsFor): New model — fromDb/toDb, toExport/fromExport (seconds),
    displayNumber, hasContent, identity by (itemId, unitType, parent, unit).
  * lib/core/database/migrations/migration_v53.dart (MigrationV53): New
    `item_marks` table (unique unit key, `idx_item_marks_item`, FK cascade).
  * lib/core/database/dao/item_mark_dao.dart (ItemMarkDao): merge upsert that
    deletes empty rows and returns the merged mark; getMarksForItem /
    getMarksForItems / setFavorite / setComment / deleteMark / insertMarks.
  * lib/features/collections/providers/item_marks_provider.dart
    (itemMarksProvider, ItemMarksNotifier, ItemMarksState): family by itemId
    with per-type liked/commented counters and
    toggleFavorite/setComment/deleteMark.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/item_mark_controls.dart (ItemMarkControls,
    ItemMarkNoteEditor, MarkNoteText, unitTypeLabel): reusable heart plus
    inline autosaving note editor.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/item_marks_list_section.dart
    (ItemMarksListSection): branch-B add-form + existing-marks list.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/episode_tracker_section.dart
    (EpisodeTrackerSection, SeasonsListWidget, SeasonExpansionTile,
    EpisodeTile): thread itemId, inline controls, summary + filter bar.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/anime_progress_section.dart,
    manga_progress_section.dart: embed ItemMarksListSection.
  * lib/core/services/export_service.dart (_attachItemMarks),
    import_service.dart (_importItemMarks): `_marks` per item, gated on user
    data, remapped to the new item id.
  * lib/core/database/database_service.dart (itemMarkDao),
    migration_registry.dart (MigrationV53): registration; DB version 52 → 53.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, app_ru.arb: itemMark* / unit* strings.

- **Import a game list exported from IGDB (CSV)**

  A new import source under Settings → Import. Every export row carries the
  IGDB game id, so titles are matched in one batched id lookup with no fuzzy
  search; ids IGDB no longer returns fall back to the text wishlist under an
  `IGDB-<timestamp>` tag. The export has no personal data, so the status is
  picked once for the whole file (the card status switcher) and the platform
  is chosen from the same searchable platform list used in search — required,
  since without it every item would render as "unknown platform". Re-import is
  idempotent: an unset status leaves existing items untouched, a chosen status
  only bumps upward without downgrading the user's own decision.

  * lib/core/import/sources/igdb_list/igdb_list_csv_parser.dart (IgdbListCsvParser,
    IgdbListEntry, IgdbListParseException): New RFC 4180 CSV parser addressing
    columns by header; reads only `id` and `game`.
  * lib/core/import/sources/igdb_list/igdb_list_import_service.dart (IgdbListImportService,
    IgdbListImportOptions, igdbListImportServiceProvider): New import adapter over
    the shared ImportWriter; matches via IgdbApi.getGamesByIds, applies a required
    platform and a per-file status.
  * lib/features/settings/content/igdb_list_import_content.dart (IgdbListImportContent):
    New form — file picker, StatusChipRow, searchable platform picker, collection target.
  * lib/features/settings/screens/igdb_list_import_screen.dart (IgdbListImportScreen): New.
  * lib/features/settings/screens/settings_screen.dart: New import tile after Steam.
  * lib/features/search/widgets/filter_dropdown.dart (SearchableFilterDialog.showAllOption):
    Add flag to hide the leading "All" reset row when a selection is mandatory.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb (settingsIgdbImport, igdbImportTitle,
    igdbImportPlatformSelect and related keys): New strings.
  * README.md: List IGDB in the import table.

- **Setting to always show subcategory filters**

  A new appearance toggle keeps the subcategory subfilters (game platforms,
  anime / manga formats) visible without first selecting their media-type
  chevron. Off by default; mirrors how the other appearance toggles persist.
  Applies to both the collection screen and the all-items (Home) screen.

  * lib/features/settings/providers/settings_provider.dart (SettingsKeys.alwaysShowSubcategories,
    SettingsState.alwaysShowSubcategories, SettingsNotifier.setAlwaysShowSubcategories):
    New persisted flag with loader, copyWith, setter and clear handling.
  * lib/features/settings/screens/settings_screen.dart: New toggle tile under appearance.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_filter_bar.dart
    (_CollectionFilterBarState._subfilterGroups, _formatGroup): Gate subfilters on
    the setting in addition to the selected type.
  * lib/features/home/screens/all_items_screen.dart
    (_AllItemsScreenState._subfilterGroups, _formatGroup): Same gating for the Home grid.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb (settingsAlwaysShowSubcategories,
    settingsAlwaysShowSubcategoriesSubtitle): New strings.

- **Universal progress tracker for custom items**

  Custom cards now carry a count and reading/watching progress, mirroring manga
  and anime. A fine axis (episodes / chapters / pages / parts) and, for types
  with a sub-division, a coarse axis (seasons for series, volumes for manga);
  the unit labels follow the card's display type. Totals are entered in the
  create / edit form and the item detail shows a +/- progress section that
  auto-advances the status (in-progress / completed) just like the real types.
  Totals live on the item's own row, so exports, backups and sync carry them;
  the "done" position reuses the existing `current_episode` / `current_season`
  slots, so no new progress columns.

  * lib/core/database/migrations/migration_v52.dart (MigrationV52),
    migration_registry.dart, database_service.dart (version): Add `unit_total`
    and `unit_group_total` to `custom_items`; DB version 51 → 52.
  * lib/shared/models/custom_media.dart (CustomMedia.unitTotal, unitGroupTotal),
    lib/shared/models/collection_item.dart (CollectionItem.customUnitTotal,
    customUnitGroupTotal): New fields / accessors.
  * lib/shared/utils/custom_progress_units.dart (CustomProgressUnits): Resolves
    fine / coarse unit labels and whether a display type has a coarse axis.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/custom_progress_section.dart
    (CustomProgressSection): Universal +/- progress section.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/item_detail/item_detail_media_config.dart
    (hasCustomProgress), lib/features/collections/screens/item_detail_screen.dart:
    Render the section for custom items.
  * lib/features/collections/providers/collections_provider.dart
    (_autoUpdateCustomStatus): Status follows custom progress.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/create_custom_item_dialog.dart
    (_buildCountsSection), custom_item/custom_item_data.dart (unitTotal,
    unitGroupTotal): Total inputs in the create / edit form.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb (customProgress,
    customMarkCompleted, customUnit*): New strings.

- **Custom items count under their masqueraded type, with platform / format subfilters**

  A custom card that masquerades as a real type (e.g. a custom "anime") now
  surfaces under that type's filter chevron — on the collection screen and on
  All Items — and still under "Custom", since it is a custom element either way;
  the chevron counts follow suit (it is tallied in both). Custom games can pick a
  platform and custom manga / anime a format, both strictly from the existing
  reference lists (no free-text), so the platform and format subfilters include
  them too. Stored on the item's own row, so exports, backups and network sync
  carry them.

  * lib/core/database/migrations/migration_v51.dart (MigrationV51),
    lib/core/database/migrations/migration_registry.dart (MigrationRegistry.all),
    lib/core/database/database_service.dart (version): Add `platform_id` and
    `format` to `custom_items`; DB version 50 → 51.
  * lib/shared/models/custom_media.dart (CustomMedia.platformId,
    CustomMedia.format, fromDb, toDb, copyWith): New fields.
  * lib/shared/models/collection_item.dart (CollectionItem.effectivePlatformId,
    CollectionItem.formatCode, formatLabel, filterTypeBuckets,
    matchesTypeFilter): Resolve platform / format through the custom item when it
    masquerades, and place it in both its display-type and Custom filter buckets.
  * lib/features/collections/helpers/collection_filters.dart (CollectionFilters.apply),
    lib/shared/utils/media_format.dart (MediaFormat.present, matchesFormatFilter):
    Filter by effective type / platform / format.
  * lib/core/database/dao/collection_dao.dart (_loadJoinedData): Hydrate the
    platform object for custom games.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_filter_bar.dart
    (_effectiveTotals, _typeCounts, _extractPlatforms),
    lib/features/home/screens/all_items_screen.dart (_applyFilter,
    _matchesNonTypeFilters, _countByMediaType, _rawTotalsByMediaType),
    lib/features/home/providers/all_items_provider.dart (allItemsPlatformsProvider):
    Count and subfilter by effective type / platform.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/create_custom_item_dialog.dart
    (_pickPlatform, _buildFormatChip, _pickFormat),
    custom_item/custom_item_data.dart (CustomItemData.platformId, format):
    Reference-list-only pickers.
  * lib/core/services/export_service.dart (custom export case): Export the custom
    game's platform so the target resolves it after import.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb (customItemFormat): New.

- **Personalization step in the welcome menu tour**

  The coachmark tour now highlights the centre nav button (genre cloud +
  recommendations), which it previously skipped because that button is a
  shell-level destination rather than a nav tab. The tour scrim is also denser
  so the app's text behind it no longer bleeds through the description card.

  * lib/shared/navigation/nav_tour_keys.dart (NavTourKeys.personalization): New
    stable key for the centre button.
  * lib/shared/navigation/app_sidebar.dart (AppSidebar.build),
    lib/shared/navigation/app_bottom_bar.dart (AppBottomBar.build): Attach the
    personalization key to NavCenterButton while the tour runs.
  * lib/features/welcome/widgets/menu_tour_items.dart (MenuTourItem,
    buildMenuTourItems): Make `tab` nullable for the centre-button step and
    insert it at the centre slot in menu order.
  * lib/features/welcome/widgets/menu_tour_overlay.dart
    (_MenuTourOverlayState._syncSpot, _MenuTourOverlayState._readRect,
    _SpotlightPainter): Drive the spotlight off the item list, resolve the centre
    button by its key, and raise the scrim alpha from 130 to 200.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb (welcomeHowPersonalizationDesc): New.

- **Carry app settings and API keys over network sync**

  Receiving data from another device now offers an "Also transfer settings"
  checkbox (on by default, all-or-nothing) that pulls the sending device's full
  configuration — every preference plus all API keys and source logins — and
  applies it here. The bundle rides a new `/config` endpoint alongside the
  database and images, is written straight to preferences, and takes effect on
  the restart the received database requires anyway. The checkbox only appears
  when the sending device is new enough to serve its config. The transfer stays
  on the local network in the clear, like the database it accompanies.

  * lib/shared/models/sync_manifest.dart (SyncManifest.supportsSettingsTransfer):
    New capability flag (`supports_settings`), absent on older peers so the
    receiver hides the option.
  * lib/core/services/db_sync_service.dart (DbSyncService.buildManifest):
    Advertise supportsSettingsTransfer.
  * lib/core/services/lan_sync_service.dart (LanSyncService._serveConfig,
    LanSyncService.downloadConfig): New `/config` endpoint serving the full
    ConfigService bundle, plus the client that fetches and applies it;
    LanSyncService now takes a ConfigService.
  * lib/features/settings/screens/lan_sync_screen.dart
    (_LanSyncScreenState._askReceiveOptions, _ReceiveChoice): Receive dialog
    grows the opt-in checkbox; the pull applies the bundle after the database.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb (lanSyncImportConfig,
    lanSyncImportConfigSubtitle, lanSyncReceivingSettings): New.

- **Tier list: drop a card at an exact position and reorder whole tiers**

  Dropping a card onto another card now inserts it right before that card —
  while hovering, a gap with a bright insertion bar opens at the exact target
  position; hovering empty row space shows the bar after the last card and
  appends to the end. A whole tier — with its contents — can be moved up or
  down: on desktop by dragging its colored label onto another tier row, and
  everywhere via new "Move up" / "Move down" actions in the tier options
  sheet. Plain Draggable is used instead of ReorderableListView, whose
  GlobalKey reparenting crashes with card tooltips (OverlayPortal) inside
  the screen's LayoutBuilder.

  * lib/features/tier_lists/widgets/tier_row.dart (TierRow.onDrop,
    TierRow._handleSlotDrop, TierRow.tierDraggable, TierRow._labelBox,
    _TierCardSlot, _InsertionBar): Per-card drop slots opening an animated
    insertion-bar gap on hover; the label becomes a Draggable with the tier
    key as payload.
  * lib/features/tier_lists/widgets/tier_list_view.dart (_TierRowDropTarget,
    _TierListViewState._showTierOptions): Per-row drop target for tier keys;
    move up/down entries in the options sheet.
  * lib/features/tier_lists/providers/tier_list_detail_provider.dart
    (TierListDetailNotifier.moveTier): Reorder definitions and persist
    renumbered sort orders.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb (tierListMoveUp,
    tierListMoveDown): New.

### Changed

- **Show the item cover as the Discord Rich Presence large image**

  The Discord status now uses the current item's real cover (game / movie /
  manga art) as the large image, with the app logo moved to the small icon for
  branding. Custom items with a local-file cover fall back to the logo since
  Discord can only fetch remote URLs; the RetroAchievements icon still takes the
  small slot when present.

  * lib/core/services/discord_rpc_service.dart (DiscordRpcService.updatePresence,
    DiscordRpcService._remoteCoverUrl): Build the large/small assets from the
    item's cover URL, falling back to the logo.

- **Kinorium import: restore title matching and explain every wishlist skip**

  Title matching is back: when no TMDB result carries the row's exact year the
  importer keeps the best title match instead of dropping the row, so far fewer
  real films are missed. Rows that still can't be imported now land in the
  wishlist with the reason spelled out in their note — not found on TMDB, a TMDB
  error or rate limit, an unsupported type (the original Kinorium kind is named,
  e.g. "Эпизод"), or a duplicate of another row's title. The reasons are
  localized.

  * lib/core/import/tmdb_matcher.dart (TmdbMatcher._search, _pickBest): Prefer
    the matching-year result, otherwise fall back to the first (title) result.
  * lib/core/import/sources/kinorium/kinorium_import_service.dart
    (KinoriumImportOptions.reasons, KinoriumWishlistReasons, KinoriumImportService.import,
    _composeNote): Track a per-row skip reason and prepend it to the wishlist note.
  * lib/core/import/sources/kinorium/kinorium_entry.dart (KinoriumEntry.rawType,
    typeLabel), kinorium_csv_parser.dart: Keep the verbatim `Type` text so the
    reason can name the original kind.
  * lib/features/settings/content/kinorium_import_content.dart
    (_KinoriumImportContentState._startImport): Build the localized reasons from
    the UI and pass them into the import.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb (kinoriumReasonNotFound,
    kinoriumReasonApiError, kinoriumReasonUnsupportedType, kinoriumReasonDuplicate):
    New strings.

- **Mark the Uncategorized collection as deprecated across the UI**

  The Uncategorized bucket is now a read-only legacy collection: it can no
  longer be picked as a move/add destination, its card and list tile show a red
  "will be removed" warning, the All Items screen shows a deprecation banner
  above the group, and the add-items FAB and Ctrl+N shortcut are hidden while
  viewing it.

  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_card.dart (UncategorizedCard),
    lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_list_tile.dart
    (UncategorizedListTile): Red warning triangle plus badge text; the card uses
    a FittedBox so the warning never overflows a small grid cell.
  * lib/shared/widgets/uncategorized_deprecation_banner.dart
    (UncategorizedDeprecationBanner): New banner shown on All Items.
  * lib/features/home/screens/all_items_screen.dart
    (_CollectionGroup.isUncategorized): Flag the Uncategorized group and render
    the banner above it.
  * lib/features/collections/helpers/collection_actions.dart
    (CollectionActions.moveItem),
    lib/features/collections/screens/item_detail_screen.dart
    (_ItemDetailScreenState._moveToCollection),
    lib/features/collections/widgets/bulk_action_bar.dart
    (BulkActionBar._handleMove),
    lib/features/search/services/search_collection_adder.dart
    (SearchCollectionAdder.pickCollection): Pass showUncategorized: false to the
    collection picker.
  * lib/features/collections/screens/collection_screen.dart
    (_CollectionScreenState._buildScreenShortcuts),
    lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_screen/collection_screen_fab.dart
    (CollectionScreenFab._mainAction): Hide the add-items shortcut and FAB for it.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb (uncategorizedDeprecationBadge,
    uncategorizedDeprecationNotice): New.

- **Collection items re-sort immediately after an in-card edit**

  Changing rating, status, progress, favorite, comments or the override name in
  the item card now re-applies the active sort right away, so the item moves to
  its correct place instead of staying put until you re-enter. Any such edit
  also counts as activity (stamps last_activity_at), so it surfaces in the "by
  activity" sort. Manual (drag-and-drop) order is never re-sorted, and the
  re-sort is local — no reload, so the list does not flash.

  * lib/features/collections/providers/collections_provider.dart
    (CollectionItemsNotifier._patchItem, CollectionItemsNotifier._stampActivity):
    New helpers; every card-edit method routes through them.
  * lib/features/collections/providers/collections_provider.dart
    (CollectionItemsNotifier.updateStatus, CollectionItemsNotifier.setFavorite,
    CollectionItemsNotifier.updateActivityDates,
    CollectionItemsNotifier.updateProgress,
    CollectionItemsNotifier.updateAuthorComment,
    CollectionItemsNotifier.updateUserComment,
    CollectionItemsNotifier.setOverrideName,
    CollectionItemsNotifier.updateUserRating,
    CollectionItemsNotifier.addTimeSpent, CollectionItemsNotifier.setTimeSpent):
    Stamp activity and re-sort when the edited field feeds the active mode.

- **Sort-direction labels spell out the order instead of "ascending/descending"**

  The direction toggle now reads "Newest first / Oldest first", "Highest first /
  Lowest first", etc. per mode, so it no longer claims "ascending" while showing
  newest/highest on top.

  * lib/shared/models/collection_sort_mode.dart
    (CollectionSortMode.localizedDirectionLabel): New.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_filter_bar.dart,
    lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_filter_sheet.dart: Use the
    mode-aware label instead of collectionFilterAscending/Descending.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb (sortDateOldest, sortStatusFinished,
    sortNameZa, sortRatingLowest, sortFavoriteLast, sortExternalRatingLowest,
    sortLastActivityOldest): New.

### Fixed

- **Tier list: card order no longer shuffles after an app restart**

  Placing a card assigned it a sort order equal to the tier's current size
  while removals left gaps, so different cards could end up with the same
  sort order — and the load query returned them in unspecified (rowid)
  order, reshuffling the tier between sessions. Every move now rewrites the
  whole target tier with contiguous sort orders in one transaction, and
  tiers already broken by older builds are renumbered once on load,
  freezing the currently visible order.

  * lib/core/database/dao/tier_list_dao.dart (TierListDao.setItemTierOrdered,
    TierListDao._writeContiguousOrders): New transactional move that
    renumbers the target tier; reorderTierItems shares the renumber pass.
  * lib/features/tier_lists/providers/tier_list_detail_provider.dart
    (TierListDetailNotifier.moveToTier,
    TierListDetailNotifier._normalizeSortOrders): Insert at index with
    clamping and full-tier renumber; one-time self-heal of gaps and
    duplicates on load.

- **Google Books: keep the real cover when adding a book to a collection**

  Search showed the correct cover, but adding the book (and "Refresh from
  source") swapped it for an interior page scan: the volume-detail
  `imageLinks` sizes (`small`..`extraLarge`) are page scans for scanned
  volumes despite `printsec=frontcover`, and the largest size was preferred.
  The cover is now always built from the thumbnail — the only size that
  reliably carries the cover — upscaled to 800px width via Google's `fife`
  parameter, which also sharpens Google Books covers in search results.
  Existing items pick the fix up via the item's "Refresh from source" button.

  * lib/shared/models/book.dart (Book._googleCover): Use only `thumbnail` /
    `smallThumbnail`, strip `&edge=curl`, upgrade to HTTPS, append
    `&fife=w800`.

- **Stop the app-wide slowdown after visiting Personalization**

  The Personalization screen used to stay mounted forever after its first
  open: the genre cloud re-aggregated the whole library on every change (plus
  an always-mounted offscreen export copy re-running the full word placement),
  and the recommendations pipeline with its posters stayed alive too — on
  mobile this dragged the entire app, snackbars included. The screen now
  unmounts on leave and builds only the selected view; the expensive cloud
  placement is deferred behind a progress indicator instead of freezing the
  first frame for seconds; the export copy mounts only while saving the PNG.
  Fetched recommendations are pinned in their provider, so a revisit shows
  them instantly without re-fetching. Hidden shell tabs no longer run their
  animations (tag glow, shimmer), and the tag-glow border repaints without
  re-rasterizing the whole card — both smooth every animation on mobile.

  * lib/shared/navigation/app_shell.dart (_openPreferenceCloud, _buildContent):
    Drop the keep-alive `_personalizationEverOpened` flag — the screen is in
    the IndexedStack only while open; wrap hidden tab navigators in
    `TickerMode(enabled: false)`.
  * lib/features/personalization/screens/personalization_screen.dart
    (_PersonalizationScreenState.build): Build only the selected view instead
    of an IndexedStack keeping both alive.
  * lib/features/genre_cloud/widgets/genre_cloud_view.dart
    (_GenreCloudViewState._scheduleLayout, _cachedLayout, _computeWithGrowth):
    Defer the placement past the first frame; show a progress indicator until
    it lands.
  * lib/features/genre_cloud/screens/genre_cloud_screen.dart
    (_GenreCloudScreenState._exportAsImage, _exporting): Mount the offscreen
    export view only for the duration of an export.
  * lib/features/recommendations/providers/recommendations_provider.dart
    (recommendationsProvider): `ref.keepAlive()` after the network fetch so
    results survive the screen unmounting; refresh still invalidates.
  * lib/shared/widgets/media_poster_card.dart (_TagGlowWrapperState.build):
    RepaintBoundary around the card so the animated border repaints alone.

- **API Keys counter no longer counts built-in default keys**

  In production builds with TMDB / SteamGridDB / IGDB keys baked in via
  `--dart-define`, the Settings "API Keys" tally showed e.g. 2/6 even with no
  user-entered keys and empty credential fields. It now counts only keys the
  user actually set, matching the credentials screen (0/6 on a fresh install).

  * lib/features/settings/screens/settings_screen.dart
    (_SettingsScreenState._apiKeyStates): Exclude built-in defaults via
    isIgdbKeyBuiltIn / isSteamGridDbKeyBuiltIn / isTmdbKeyBuiltIn.

- **"My Rating" sort ignores the external rating**

  It now ranks by the user's own rating only; items the user has not rated sort
  last (by name), instead of being ranked by their external API rating — which
  used to push an unrated-but-high-API item above personally-rated ones.

  * lib/features/collections/providers/sort_utils.dart (applySortMode): Drop the
    apiRating fallback for CollectionSortMode.rating; add a name tie-break.

- **"By activity" sort no longer sinks freshly added items**

  An item never touched since it was added now falls back to its added date for
  the activity sort, so new items don't drop below older ones with a stale
  activity date.

  * lib/features/collections/providers/sort_utils.dart (applySortMode): Use
    lastActivityAt ?? addedAt for CollectionSortMode.lastActivity.

## [0.36.0] - 2026-06-26

### Added

- **Personalization word cloud of genres, platforms and decades**

  A new Personalization view that lays out the whole library's genres, platforms
  and release decades as a frequency-sized word cloud. Word size follows how
  often a value appears; word colour follows the dominant media type. Two chip
  rows filter the cloud by facet (genres / platforms / decades) and by media
  type, and the result can be saved as a PNG poster. The view opens from the new
  centre nav button, which replaces the old top-bar logo; the nav row and rail
  reserve a middle slot for it.

  * lib/features/genre_cloud/facet.dart (Facet), genre_cloud/facet_value.dart
    (FacetValue): The facet dimensions and a single (facet, value) tally. New.
  * lib/features/genre_cloud/genre_cloud_aggregate.dart (extractItemFacets,
    aggregateFacets, presentFacets, presentMediaTypes): Pure aggregation over
    collection items, reading the typed sub-models. Counting is case-insensitive
    and de-duped per item. New.
  * lib/features/genre_cloud/genre_cloud_layout.dart (layoutGenreCloud,
    PlacedWord, GenreCloudLayout, rotatedAtIndex): Flutter-free Archimedean
    spiral placement with rank-based font tiers and auto-fit shrinking. New.
  * lib/features/genre_cloud/widgets/genre_cloud_view.dart (GenreCloudView,
    genreWordSpan, measureGenreWord): On-screen painter sharing one span builder
    between measurement and painting. Grows the canvas to fit every word, wraps
    it in an InteractiveViewer for pan and pinch-zoom, and shows a recenter
    button that restores the default centred view. New.
  * lib/features/genre_cloud/widgets/genre_cloud_export_view.dart
    (GenreCloudExportView): Fixed 1200×800 poster captured to PNG; renders the
    cloud non-interactively. New.
  * lib/features/genre_cloud/providers/genre_cloud_provider.dart
    (genreCloudItemsProvider): Exposes the whole library's items from the
    all-items notifier. New.
  * lib/features/genre_cloud/screens/genre_cloud_screen.dart (GenreCloudScreen, GenreCloudScreen.showTitle):
    Facet legend, media-type legend, cloud and image export; `showTitle` hides
    the screen's own title strip when the cloud is embedded under the
    Personalization tab. New.
  * lib/shared/navigation/nav_center_button.dart (NavCenterButton): The app logo
    as a focusable centre nav item. New.
  * lib/shared/navigation/nav_destinations.dart (kNavCenterSlot, navSelectedSlot):
    Shared centre-slot index and the selected-index → visual-slot mapping that
    skips the reserved centre slot.
  * lib/shared/navigation/app_bottom_bar.dart (AppBottomBar.onCenterTap,
    AppBottomBar.centerActive), lib/shared/navigation/app_sidebar.dart
    (AppSidebar.onCenterTap, AppSidebar.centerActive): Reserve the middle slot,
    draw the centre button, and highlight it when Personalization is open.
  * lib/shared/navigation/app_shell.dart (_AppShellState._openPreferenceCloud,
    _AppShellState._openSearchTab): Show the Personalization hub as a shell-level
    destination (an extra IndexedStack child), toggled by the centre nav button;
    an incoming search request closes the hub when it is open over another tab.
  * lib/shared/navigation/app_top_bar.dart: Drop the top-bar logo, now shown as
    the centre nav button.

- **Content-based movie and TV recommendations**

  A second Personalization tab suggests movies and shows learned from the user's
  completed, rated and favorited library. Taste is clustered by genre (rare
  genres weighted higher via IDF); candidates come from TMDB (recommendations
  and similar titles for what you liked, topped up by discover-by-genre),
  scored, and grouped into "Because you liked …" rows. Each row is a
  self-contained section card with a two-tier header — an uppercase reason label
  over the driver titles — and the cluster's defining genres as chips, so coarse
  matches stay explainable while feedback is gathered. Rows lead with the highest
  TMDB-rated picks. A pinned collection chips row adds a pick straight into the
  selected collections, or, with nothing selected, opens the same details sheet
  Search uses. The Personalization hub switches between the genre cloud and
  recommendations with a segmented pill.

  * lib/features/recommendations/engine/sparse_vector.dart (SparseVector):
    Sparse feature vector — norm, dot, cosine, normalized, weightedSum. New.
  * lib/features/recommendations/engine/recommendation_config.dart
    (RecommendationConfig): Engine tuning constants in one place. New.
  * lib/features/recommendations/engine/recommendation_models.dart (TasteTitle,
    ScoredTitle, TasteCluster, TasteProfile, RecommendationRow): Media-agnostic
    engine types. New.
  * lib/features/recommendations/engine/recommender.dart (Recommender): IDF,
    per-title weights, deterministic cosine k-means taste profile, candidate
    scoring with a dislike penalty, similarTo and kNN predictRating. Pure Dart. New.
  * lib/features/recommendations/tmdb_taste_input.dart (GenreKeyResolver,
    tasteTitleFromItem, tasteTitleFromMovie, tasteTitleFromTvShow, ownedTasteIds,
    movieTasteId, tvTasteId): Adapter from TMDB models to engine TasteTitles.
    GenreKeyResolver collapses every genre token — a numeric id or a localized
    name in any language and case — to its TMDB id, the one key identical across
    languages, so genres match regardless of the request language. New.
  * lib/features/recommendations/providers/recommendations_provider.dart
    (recommendationsProvider, RecommendedItem, RecommendationRowUi,
    RecommendationResult, RecommendationStatus, recommendationTargetCollectionsProvider,
    collectedRecommendationIdsProvider, byRatingDesc): Learns one taste profile
    from the completed library, fetches candidates via the shared TMDB client in
    the user's content language (titles render localized), matches them to the
    profile by genre id, scores them and sorts each row highest-rated first.
    Distinguishes empty / no-API-key / no-candidates states. Reads the library
    once and tracks added titles via the collected-id provider, so adding a pick
    marks just that card without reloading the list. New.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb (personalizationTabCloud,
    personalizationTabRecommendations, recommendationsRefresh, recommendationsEmpty,
    recommendationsEmptyHint, recommendationsNoCandidates, recommendationsNoCandidatesHint,
    recommendationsNoApiKey, recommendationsNoApiKeyHint, recommendationsBecauseLabel,
    recommendationsCount): Personalization and recommendation strings.
  * lib/features/recommendations/widgets/recommendation_row.dart
    (RecommendationRowWidget, RecommendationsEmptyState): Section card for one
    "because you liked" group — a two-tier header (uppercase reason label over
    the driver titles), the cluster's genres as chips, and a horizontal carousel
    of recommended cards. A card whose title is already in a collection renders
    dimmed, checked and non-interactive. Plus the empty / no-candidates
    placeholder. New.
  * lib/features/recommendations/screens/recommendations_screen.dart
    (RecommendationsScreen): A titled header (the tab name plus a live "N
    recommendations" count) with the refresh action, section-card rows, empty
    states, the target-collection chips row, and add-from-card routed through the
    Search MediaHandlers; tapped picks are marked added in place. New.
  * lib/features/personalization/screens/personalization_screen.dart
    (PersonalizationScreen): Two-view hub (genre cloud + recommendations)
    switched by a SegmentedPill over an IndexedStack. New.
  * lib/features/search/widgets/collection_chips_row.dart
    (CollectionChipsRow.targetProvider): Accept a selection provider so the
    Recommendations tab keeps its own target-collection selection, independent
    of Search.

- **Mark collection items as favorite**

  A per-item favorite flag the user sets from the poster card (a heart in the
  top-right corner), the item detail screen, the right-click / long-press menu,
  or the table view. Favorites are per collection item, so the same title in
  two collections is tracked independently. The collection table gains a
  favorite column with an inline toggle and a header filter that cycles all →
  favorites only → non-favorites only; the collection Sort menu gains a
  "Favorite" mode (favorites first); and the home (All Items) screen gains a
  favorites-only toggle in the filter bar after the status filter, persisted
  per profile. The flag travels in `.xcollx` exports and backups under the
  "personal data" toggle.

  * lib/core/database/migrations/migration_v50.dart (MigrationV50): New — adds
    the `is_favorite` column to `collection_items` via idempotent
    `addColumnIfAbsent`.
  * lib/core/database/migrations/migration_registry.dart (MigrationRegistry.all),
    lib/core/database/database_service.dart (DatabaseService.setItemFavorite):
    Register v50 and bump the schema version 49 → 50; delegate the setter to the DAO.
  * lib/core/database/dao/collection_dao.dart (CollectionDao.setItemFavorite),
    lib/data/repositories/collection_repository.dart (CollectionRepository.setItemFavorite):
    Single-column update of `is_favorite`.
  * lib/shared/models/collection_item.dart (CollectionItem.isFavorite, CollectionItem.fromDbWithJoins, CollectionItem.toDb, CollectionItem.fromExport, CollectionItem.toExport, CollectionItem.copyWith, CollectionItem.internalDbFields):
    New field; round-trips through the DB and, under `user_data`, the export.
  * lib/features/collections/providers/collections_provider.dart (CollectionItemsNotifier.toggleFavorite, CollectionItemsNotifier.setFavorite, HomeFavoriteFilterNotifier, homeFavoriteFilterProvider),
    lib/features/home/providers/all_items_provider.dart (AllItemsNotifier.toggleFavorite, AllItemsNotifier.updateFavoriteLocally):
    Persist with an optimistic local patch. All Items toggles write the DB,
    patch the All Items list, and invalidate the item's per-collection notifier
    so the collection grid and detail screen reload the new flag — avoiding a
    race where a freshly-built, still-loading collection notifier overwrote it
    with its pre-write snapshot. `HomeFavoriteFilterNotifier` holds the home
    favorites-only filter, persisted per profile.
  * lib/features/home/screens/all_items_screen.dart (AllItemsScreen._buildMediaTypeBar, AllItemsScreen._matchesNonTypeFilters, AllItemsScreen._countByMediaType),
    lib/shared/widgets/chevron_filter_bar.dart (StatusDropdownSegment.isLast):
    Favorites-only chevron segment after the status filter; `isLast` lets the
    status segment grow a right-pointing edge so the favorite segment can follow.
  * lib/shared/widgets/media_poster_card.dart (MediaPosterCard.isFavorite, MediaPosterCard.showFavorite, MediaPosterCard.onToggleFavorite, _FavoriteButton):
    Heart badge in the top-right stack — small visible circle with a finger-sized
    tap target, shown as a static indicator during multi-select.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/item_detail/item_detail_app_bar.dart (ItemDetailAppBar.onToggleFavorite),
    lib/features/collections/screens/item_detail_screen.dart: Heart toggle in the detail app bar.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_items_view.dart, lib/features/home/screens/all_items_screen.dart:
    Favorite entry in the item context menu; wire the card heart toggle.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_table/table_column.dart (TableColumn.favorite),
    lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_table/table_header.dart (TableHeader.filterFavorite),
    lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_table/table_row.dart (TableRow.onFavoriteToggled),
    lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_table/collection_table_view.dart (CollectionTableView.onFavoriteToggled),
    lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_table/cells/favorite_cell.dart (FavoriteCell):
    Favorite table column with an inline toggle and a three-state header filter.
  * lib/shared/models/collection_sort_mode.dart (CollectionSortMode.favorite),
    lib/features/collections/providers/sort_utils.dart (applySortMode, _compareByDisplayName):
    "Favorite" sort mode (favorites first, then by name); extracted the shared name comparison.
  * lib/core/services/import_service.dart (ImportService._hasUserData, ImportService._restoreUserData):
    Restore `is_favorite` on import.
  * lib/shared/theme/app_colors.dart (AppColors.favorite): New heart colour.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb (favorite, addToFavorites, removeFromFavorites, sortFavoriteDisplay, sortFavoriteShort, sortFavoriteDesc): New strings.
  * docs/RCOLL_FORMAT.md: Document the `is_favorite` user-data field.

- **Show average time-to-beat on game search cards**

  IGDB game search and browse cards now carry a clock badge with the average
  time to beat (IGDB `game_time_to_beats`), in whole hours. The value is the
  normal playthrough, falling back to the rushed or completionist figure. It is
  fetched per page alongside the results and kept only in memory — never written
  to the database — so it appears on the search screen only.

  * lib/shared/models/game_time_to_beat.dart (GameTimeToBeat, GameTimeToBeat.fromJson, GameTimeToBeat.primarySeconds, GameTimeToBeat.primaryHours):
    New — transient model wrapping IGDB time-to-beat (seconds), with the
    primary-value selection and hours rounding.
  * lib/core/api/igdb/igdb_games_api.dart (IgdbGamesApi.getTimeToBeat), lib/core/api/igdb_api.dart (IgdbApi.getTimeToBeat):
    Fetch `game_time_to_beats` for a batch of game ids (batched by 500), keyed
    by game id.
  * lib/shared/models/game.dart (Game.timeToBeat, Game.copyWith): New transient
    field, excluded from `toDb` / `fromDb` / `fromJson`.
  * lib/features/search/sources/igdb_games_source.dart (IgdbGamesSource.fetch, IgdbGamesSource._attachTimeToBeat):
    Attach time-to-beat to each game with one batched request; best-effort, so a
    failure leaves the search results unchanged.
  * lib/features/search/widgets/browse_grid.dart (_BrowseGridState._buildCard):
    Pass `timeToBeatHours: item.timeToBeat?.primaryHours` for game cards.
  * lib/shared/widgets/media_poster_card.dart (MediaPosterCard.timeToBeatHours):
    New optional clock badge drawn over the poster (grid/compact), hidden when a
    status badge is shown; reuses the `runtimeHours` localization.

- **Show manga/anime format on cards and filter by it**

  Manga and anime cards now caption the specific format (Manhwa, OVA, Light
  Novel, …) instead of the generic "Manga"/"Anime"; titles with no reported
  format keep the generic caption. Selecting the Manga or Anime filter chevron —
  inside a collection and on the Home tab — reveals format subfilter chips built
  from the formats actually present, mirroring the platform subfilter for games.
  Game-platform, manga-format and anime-format subfilters share one row, each
  drawn as a flat underline tab tinted with its media-type accent. The format
  filter narrows the whole list to the chosen format like the platform filter
  does for games — everything else is hidden; selecting both a manga and an
  anime format keeps either.

  * lib/shared/utils/media_format.dart (MediaFormat.present, MediaFormat.matchesFormatFilter, MediaFormat.label, MediaFormat.mangaOrder, MediaFormat.animeOrder):
    New — shared helper for format chip ordering, display labels, presence
    extraction, and the global narrowing match test.
  * lib/shared/widgets/filter_subfilter_bar.dart (SubfilterBar, FilterTabChip, SubfilterChipData):
    New — single-row, media-type-tinted subfilter chip bar shared by the
    collection and Home filter bars.
  * lib/shared/models/manga.dart (Manga.mangaFormatLabel), lib/shared/models/anime.dart (Anime.animeFormatLabel):
    Extract the format-to-label mapping into a static method; the instance
    `formatLabel` getter delegates to it.
  * lib/shared/models/collection_item.dart (CollectionItem.formatLabel): New
    getter returning the manga/anime format label, null for other media types.
  * lib/shared/widgets/media_poster_card.dart (MediaPosterCard.typeLabelOverride):
    New optional caption that replaces the media-type label in the subtitle row,
    falling back to the localized type label when null.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_items_view.dart, lib/features/search/widgets/browse_grid.dart, lib/features/home/screens/all_items_screen.dart:
    Pass `typeLabelOverride: item.formatLabel` when building poster cards.
  * lib/features/collections/helpers/collection_filters.dart (CollectionFilters.mangaFormats, CollectionFilters.animeFormats, CollectionFilters.apply):
    New format filter sets, applied as a single global narrowing pass.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_filter_bar.dart (CollectionFilterBar.filterMangaFormats, CollectionFilterBar.filterAnimeFormats, CollectionFilterBar.onMangaFormatToggled, CollectionFilterBar.onAnimeFormatToggled, _CollectionFilterBarState._subfilterGroups, _CollectionFilterBarState._formatGroup, _CollectionFilterBarState._formatsFor):
    Build the platform / manga / anime subfilter groups for the shared
    `SubfilterBar`.
  * lib/features/collections/screens/collection_screen.dart (_CollectionScreenState.onMangaFormatToggled, _CollectionScreenState.onTypeToggled):
    Track the format filter sets, wire toggle handlers, and clear a type's
    formats when the type is deselected.
  * lib/features/home/screens/all_items_screen.dart (_AllItemsScreenState._subfilterGroups, _AllItemsScreenState._formatGroup, _AllItemsScreenState._matchesNonTypeFilters, _AllItemsScreenState._toggleMediaType):
    Home-tab subfilter groups, filtering, and clear-on-deselect.

- **Inline manage buttons on wishlist cards** — resolve/unresolve, edit and delete on each card, next to the existing context menu.

  * lib/features/wishlist/widgets/wishlist_tile.dart (WishlistTile): trailing resolve, edit and delete icon buttons.

- **Add search results to several collections at once**

  The Search tab gains a row of collection chips under the filter bar. With
  none selected, tapping a result opens its details as before. Select one or
  more and a tap drops the result straight into every selected collection — no
  per-result dialog — and a single summary snackbar reports how many it landed
  in. A pinned counter at the row's leading edge shows how many collections are
  selected (visible even when the chips have scrolled off-screen, e.g. on a
  phone) and clears the selection on tap. Opening Search from a collection's
  "add items" prefills that collection's chip. Games still ask for the platform
  once, then reuse it for every target.

  * lib/features/search/widgets/collection_chips_row.dart (CollectionChipsRow):
    New — horizontal, multi-select chip row that reads and writes
    `searchTargetCollectionsProvider`; collapses to nothing when there are no
    collections; pins a `SelectedCountChip` at the leading edge while a
    selection is active.
  * lib/shared/widgets/selected_count_chip.dart (SelectedCountChip): New —
    reusable pinned pill showing the selected count and clearing the selection
    on tap.
  * lib/features/search/services/search_collection_adder.dart (SearchCollectionAdder.addToCollections):
    New — batch add that upserts the model and caches the image once, skips
    collections that already hold the item, drops ids of collections deleted
    while selected, and reports one summary snackbar.
  * lib/shared/navigation/search_providers.dart (searchTargetCollectionsProvider, SearchTabRequest.collectionId):
    Replace the single `searchTargetCollectionProvider` (`int?`) with a
    `Set<int>` for the multi-select selection.
  * lib/features/search/handlers/game_handler.dart (GameHandler.onTap, GameHandler._addToCollections),
    lib/features/search/handlers/movie_handler.dart (MovieHandler.onTap, MovieHandler._addToCollections),
    lib/features/search/handlers/tv_show_handler.dart (TvShowHandler.onTap, TvShowHandler._addToCollections),
    lib/features/search/handlers/simple_media_handler.dart (SimpleMediaHandler.onTap, SimpleMediaHandler._addToCollections),
    lib/features/search/handlers/media_handlers.dart (MediaHandlers):
    Take a `Set<int> Function() targetCollections` closure resolved at tap time
    and forward to `addToCollections`.
  * lib/features/search/screens/search_screen.dart (_SearchScreenState._buildHandlers):
    Read the target collections live so the handlers never rebuild when the
    selection changes; mount `CollectionChipsRow` under the filter bar.
  * lib/shared/navigation/app_shell.dart (resetSearchTabState, _AppShellState._openSearchTab):
    Reset clears the set; opening Search from a collection seeds it with that
    one id.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb (searchAddedToCollections, searchAlreadyInCollections):
    New pluralised "added to N collections" / "already in the selected
    collections" snackbar strings.

### Changed

- **Compact, consistent icons in the item-detail app bar and the top bar**

  The item-detail screen's action icons (favorite, release bell, board lock,
  board toggle, edit, overflow) shrink to match the back arrow, and the bar
  drops to the same compact height as the rest of the app. The top bar's
  settings gear and the service badges (Discord, Kodi) now share one icon size
  so they read as a single set.

  * lib/shared/widgets/screen_app_bar.dart (kScreenAppBarIconSize): New shared
    icon size for the compact bar; the leading back button references it.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/item_detail/item_detail_app_bar.dart
    (ItemDetailAppBar.preferredSize, ItemDetailAppBar): Bar height tied to
    kScreenAppBarHeight (was kToolbarHeight, leaving a too-tall bar); action
    icons sized to kScreenAppBarIconSize via a shared _action builder.
  * lib/shared/navigation/service_badges.dart (kTopBarIconSize): New shared size
    for the top bar's right-hand chrome; the service badge icons use it.
  * lib/shared/navigation/app_top_bar.dart: The settings gear uses kTopBarIconSize.

- **Config export/import now covers every credential and setting** — all source credentials (ComicVine, Google Books, ScreenScraper, RetroAchievements, Steam, AniList), the app language, and the display/feature toggles (recommendations, Blu-ray and platform overlays, Discord RPC, RA sync, rich collections, hide-empty-media chevrons).

  * lib/core/services/config_service.dart (ConfigService): export/import the new keys; add bool value support.

- **Trakt import moved onto the shared import layer** — same behaviour, batched writes.

  * lib/core/import/sources/trakt/trakt_import_service.dart (TraktImportService): relocated from lib/core/services and reimplemented as an ImportSource over ImportWriter.
  * lib/features/settings/content/trakt_import_content.dart, test/helpers/mocks.dart (MockTraktImportService): updated to the new API.

- **Media-type subfilter bar: scroll affordances and a selection highlight**

  The subfilter chip row under the search and collection filters now uses the
  same ScrollableRowWithArrows treatment as the rest of the app, so overflowing
  chips can be reached with hover arrows and the mouse wheel on desktop, not
  just a touch swipe. When any subfilter is active the whole strip is tinted
  with the selected media type's accent, so an active filter stays obvious even
  when the selected chip has scrolled off-screen.

  * lib/shared/widgets/filter_subfilter_bar.dart (SubfilterBar): Converted to a
    StatefulWidget that owns a ScrollController, wraps its row in
    ScrollableRowWithArrows, and tints the strip with the first selected chip's
    accent while a subfilter is active.

### Fixed

- **Tier list across all collections no longer shows duplicate cards**

  A global tier list (one not scoped to a single collection) pulls items from
  every collection, so a title saved in several collections showed up as one
  unranked card per collection. The unranked pool now collapses those to a
  single card per title and hides a title entirely once one of its copies is
  placed in a tier. The same game on different platforms stays separate.

  * lib/features/tier_lists/providers/tier_list_detail_provider.dart (_tierItemContentKey, _computeUnrankedItems, TierListDetailState): De-duplicate the unranked pool by media type + external id + platform for global tier lists; scoped lists are unchanged.

- **Opening search from Wishlist or a collection keeps the shell and starts clean**

  Searching for a wishlist title, or adding items to a collection, now opens the
  real Search tab prefilled instead of pushing a separate full-screen search — so
  the sidebar / top bar stay visible and there is no second search field. The
  Search tab also resets its query and results whenever it is entered, so a query
  carried over from a previous search (or a wishlist prefill) no longer sticks.

  * lib/shared/navigation/search_providers.dart (searchTabRequestProvider, SearchTabRequest, searchTargetCollectionProvider): New — a one-shot "open the Search tab, optionally prefilled and optionally targeting a collection" request, plus the add-target collection.
  * lib/shared/navigation/app_shell.dart (resetSearchTabState, _AppShellState.build, _AppShellState._onDestinationSelected, _AppShellState._resetSearchTab, _AppShellState._openSearchTab): Listen for the request and switch to the Search tab prefilled; clear query / add-target / browse search on plain entry to the tab.
  * lib/features/wishlist/screens/wishlist_screen.dart (_WishlistScreenState._searchForItem): Set the request instead of pushing SearchScreen.
  * lib/features/collections/helpers/collection_actions.dart (CollectionActions.addItems): Set the request with the collection as add target instead of pushing SearchScreen; now synchronous.
  * lib/features/collections/screens/collection_screen.dart (_CollectionScreenState): Drop the now-unused context argument from addItems calls.
  * lib/features/search/screens/search_screen.dart (SearchScreen, _SearchScreenState): Parameterless tab — removed isPushed/collectionId/initialQuery/initialSourceId/initialTabIndex/onGameSelected and its own Scaffold/AppBar; reads searchTargetCollectionProvider for add-targeting.

- **Steam credentials in an exported config now restore on import** — the saved Steam key and ID reappear after importing a config.

  * lib/core/services/config_service.dart (ConfigService): round-trip the steamRememberCredentials flag.

- **Kinorium import matches the correct title** — titles resolve by exact release year, so different films sharing a name no longer merge into one; episodes and duplicate rows go to the wishlist instead of being dropped.

  * lib/core/import/tmdb_matcher.dart (TmdbMatcher), lib/core/import/sources/kinorium/kinorium_import_service.dart (KinoriumImportService).

- **Settings no longer go blank after opening a collection from an import** — tapping the Settings gear after using "Open Collection" on the import result keeps Settings working.

  * lib/features/settings/content/kinorium_import_content.dart, lib/features/settings/content/trakt_import_content.dart, lib/features/settings/screens/kinorium_import_screen.dart, lib/features/settings/screens/trakt_import_screen.dart.

## [0.35.0] - 2026-06-19

### Added

- **Google Books book source**

  Search Google's catalogue of millions of editions by title, author, or ISBN,
  with print-type and language filters. Books share the Books tab with
  OpenLibrary and Fantlab. The API key is optional — search works anonymously,
  and a personal key (entered in Settings or the first-run wizard) only raises
  the quota. A volume's search sheet gains a "More by this author" strip (covers
  + year, hover for the blurb, tap to copy the title); a collected Google book
  gets a category-based "Similar books" row on its detail page.

  * lib/core/api/google_books_api.dart (GoogleBooksApi, GoogleBooksApiException, googleBooksApiProvider):
    New — Dio client over `/books/v1`; optional key, paged `searchVolumes`,
    `getVolume`, `validateApiKey`.
  * lib/shared/models/book.dart (Book.fromGoogleBooksVolume, fnv1a64): New
    factory; the alphanumeric `volumeId` is folded into the numeric `id`
    contract via a deterministic 63-bit FNV-1a hash (real id kept in `nativeId`).
    A zero `pageCount` from search-list rows is treated as unknown.
  * lib/shared/models/data_source.dart (DataSource.googleBooks): New value.
  * lib/shared/theme/app_assets.dart (AppAssets.iconGoogleBooksColor): New asset.
  * lib/features/search/sources/google_books_source.dart (GoogleBooksSource), lib/features/search/filters/google_books_print_type_filter.dart (GoogleBooksPrintTypeFilter), lib/features/search/filters/google_books_language_filter.dart (GoogleBooksLanguageFilter):
    New search source plus print-type and language filters.
  * lib/features/search/widgets/google_books_more_by_author_section.dart (GoogleBooksMoreByAuthorSection):
    New — lazily-paged, display-only "more by this author" strip.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/google_books_similars_section.dart (GoogleBooksSimilarsSection):
    New — category-based ("subject:") "similar books" row.
  * lib/shared/widgets/book_carousel.dart (BookCarousel, BookCarouselShimmer), lib/features/collections/widgets/book_similars_carousel.dart (BookSimilarsCarousel):
    New shared book-strip widgets; lib/features/collections/widgets/book_similars_section.dart (BookSimilarsSection) refactored onto them.
  * lib/features/search/widgets/item_details_sheet.dart (ItemDetailsSheet.book):
    Add the opaque `moreByAuthorSection` slot at the bottom of the sheet.
  * lib/features/search/handlers/media_handlers.dart (MediaHandlers): Wire the
    author strip for Google volumes and refetch via `getVolume`.
  * lib/features/collections/helpers/collection_actions.dart, lib/features/collections/screens/item_detail_screen.dart:
    Refresh and similars wiring for Google books.
  * lib/features/settings/providers/settings_provider.dart (SettingsKeys.googleBooksApiKey, SettingsNotifier.setGoogleBooksApiKey, SettingsNotifier.validateGoogleBooksKey), lib/core/services/api_key_initializer.dart (ApiKeys.googleBooksApiKey):
    Optional key storage and wiring.
  * lib/features/settings/content/credentials_content.dart, lib/features/settings/content/credits_content.dart, lib/features/welcome/widgets/welcome_step_sources.dart, lib/shared/constants/source_catalog.dart:
    Credentials field, attribution, first-run card, and source-catalogue entry.
  * lib/features/search/utils/filter_ui.dart (filterAccentForGroup): Map the
    Google Books and ComicVine groups to the book accent.
  * docs/GOOGLE_BOOKS.md, README.md: Document the source and key setup.

- **Kinorium CSV import**

  Imports a Kinorium list from its emailed CSV export (UTF-16, tab-separated).
  Every title is matched against TMDB by its original or localized name, with a
  year filter that is dropped on retry so older or alternate editions still
  match. Watched titles are imported as completed with their Kinorium rating
  and watch date; a "Watchlist" toggle imports everything as planned instead.
  Animated films and series land under the animation media type. Titles TMDB
  can't resolve are dropped into the text wishlist under a single import tag,
  and an optional toggle appends directors and actors to each item's note.
  Re-importing the same list into an existing collection refreshes only the
  rating and note when they changed. A personal TMDB key is recommended for
  large imports but not required.

  Built on a new shared import layer (`lib/core/import/`, ports & adapters) so
  future importers can shed their duplicated matching / writing / backoff logic;
  Kinorium is its first adapter and the existing importers will migrate onto it
  one at a time.

  * lib/core/import/import_source.dart (ImportSource, ImportOptions): New — the
    import port: `import(options) → UniversalImportResult`, one adapter per
    source.
  * lib/core/import/import_writer.dart (ImportWriter, ImportCandidate, WishlistCandidate, ImportWriteResult):
    New — shared write-side: resolve-or-create the collection, batch-insert new
    items, selectively update existing ones (per-source merge via a closure),
    batch-write wishlist fallbacks. Goes through the repositories, never the DAOs.
  * lib/core/import/tmdb_matcher.dart (TmdbMatcher, TmdbMatch): New — match a
    title against TMDB by name (original + localized query, year-then-no-year,
    pick-best, animation-by-genre).
  * lib/core/import/rate_limited_retry.dart (RateLimitedRetry): New —
    source-agnostic exponential backoff for 429s.
  * lib/core/import/sources/kinorium/kinorium_import_service.dart (KinoriumImportService, KinoriumImportOptions, kinoriumImportServiceProvider):
    New — the Kinorium adapter: match every row against TMDB (throttled, 429
    backoff), then write the whole scope through ImportWriter.
  * lib/core/import/sources/kinorium/kinorium_csv_parser.dart (KinoriumCsvParser, KinoriumParseException):
    New — decodes UTF-16 LE (with BOM) and parses the quoted, tab-separated body,
    addressing columns by header name so the watched and watchlist layouts (which
    order columns differently) both parse.
  * lib/core/import/sources/kinorium/kinorium_entry.dart (KinoriumEntry, KinoriumType):
    New — one parsed CSV row plus the Russian `Type` mapping and its
    movie / TV / animation search hints.
  * lib/core/database/dao/collection_dao.dart (CollectionDao.addItemsBatch, CollectionDao.updateItemFieldsBatch):
    New — transactional bulk insert (sort_order filled, unique conflicts ignored,
    inserted count returned) and selective field update.
  * lib/core/database/dao/wishlist_dao.dart (WishlistDao.addWishlistItemsBatch):
    New — transactional bulk insert of unresolved wishlist entries.
  * lib/data/repositories/collection_repository.dart (CollectionRepository.addItemsBatch, CollectionRepository.updateItemFieldsBatch),
    lib/data/repositories/wishlist_repository.dart (WishlistRepository.addWishlistItemsBatch):
    New — repository pass-throughs so the import layer writes via repositories.
  * lib/features/settings/content/kinorium_import_content.dart (KinoriumImportContent),
    lib/features/settings/screens/kinorium_import_screen.dart (KinoriumImportScreen):
    New — file pick → options (watchlist toggle, cast/crew note, target
    collection) → progress dialog.
  * lib/features/settings/screens/settings_screen.dart: Add the Kinorium import tile.
  * lib/features/settings/screens/import_result_screen.dart (ImportResultScreen):
    "Open collection" now uses `push` instead of `pushReplacement`, so an
    importer that auto-pops its screen on completion no longer immediately
    closes the collection it just opened (also fixes the existing Trakt flow).
  * lib/shared/theme/app_assets.dart (AppAssets.iconKinoriumColor),
    assets/images/icon_kinorium_color.png: Brand icon.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb (settingsKinoriumImport, settingsKinoriumImportSubtitle, kinoriumImportFrom, kinoriumImportDescription, kinoriumSelectCsvFile, kinoriumSelectCsvExport, kinoriumOptions, kinoriumIsWatchlist, kinoriumIsWatchlistDesc, kinoriumImportNotes, kinoriumImportNotesDesc, kinoriumTargetCollection, kinoriumCreateNew, kinoriumUseExisting, kinoriumNoCollections, kinoriumSelectCollection, kinoriumErrorLoadingCollections, kinoriumStartImport, kinoriumImporting, kinoriumRecommendOwnTmdbKey):
    Import screen strings.
  * docs/ARCHITECTURE.md, lib/core/import/README.md, lib/core/import/sources/kinorium/README.md:
    Document the import layer (ports & adapters) and the Kinorium adapter.
  * README.md: List Kinorium among the supported imports.

- **ComicVine comics source in search**

  Adds ComicVine (comicvine.gamespot.com) as a comics / graphic-novel source
  under the books tab. Volumes are tagged as comics so they share the book
  media type while staying separable. Text search is relevance-ranked by
  default; choosing a sort order (name A–Z / Z–A, recently updated, recently
  added) switches to a paginated `/volumes` listing. A comic's detail shows
  the issue count (not a page count), the series' creators, and its characters
  as tags — comics have no genres on ComicVine, so the character list stands in
  for them; an empty volume synopsis falls back to the first issue's. Needs a
  free ComicVine API key, entered in Settings → Credentials.

  * lib/core/api/comicvine_api.dart (ComicVineApi, ComicVineApiException, comicVineApiProvider):
    ComicVine REST client — searchVolumes (`/search`, relevance), browseVolumes
    (`/volumes` name-filter, sorted + paginated), getVolume (detail with
    people / characters, and a first-issue description fallback), validateApiKey.
    ComicVine ignores `start_year` / `publisher` / `count_of_issues` filters and
    sorts, so only the working orders are exposed.
  * lib/features/search/sources/comicvine_source.dart (ComicVineSource):
    SearchSource backed by ComicVine; relevance routes to `/search`, every other
    sort to `/volumes`; supportsSortDuringSearch is true.
  * lib/shared/models/book.dart (Book.fromComicVineVolume, Book.isComic, Book.kind, Book._comicVineNames):
    Maps a ComicVine volume to a comic-kind Book — `count_of_issues` → pageCount
    (labelled as issues), `people` → authors, `characters` → subjects, `start_year`
    → publishYear.
  * lib/shared/models/book_kind.dart (BookKind): New — prose-vs-comic discriminator persisted in `books_cache.kind`.
  * lib/core/database/migrations/migration_v49.dart (MigrationV49): New — adds the `books_cache.kind` column.
  * lib/shared/models/data_source.dart (DataSource.comicVine), lib/shared/theme/app_assets.dart (AppAssets.iconComicVineColor):
    Brand colour + logo asset (assets/images/comic_vine_color.png), surfaced via SourceLogo / SourceBadge and the credits screen.
  * lib/features/search/models/search_source.dart (BrowseSortOption.label):
    Add name_asc / name_desc / recently_updated / recently_added sort labels.
  * lib/features/settings/content/credentials_content.dart (_CredentialsContentState._buildComicVineSection, _validateComicVineKey):
    ComicVine API-key entry and validation.
  * lib/features/search/widgets/item_details_sheet.dart (ItemDetailsSheet.book), lib/features/collections/widgets/book_progress_section.dart (BookProgressSection), lib/core/services/discord_rpc_service.dart (DiscordRpcService):
    Label comics by issue count instead of page count.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb (bookIssues, browseSortNameAsc, browseSortNameDesc, browseSortRecentlyUpdated, browseSortRecentlyAdded, credentialsComicVineSection, searchSourceComics):
    Comics labels and ComicVine credential strings.

### Changed

- **API Keys settings row now shows active/total instead of a single count**

  The Data Sources → API Keys row counted only IGDB, SteamGridDB and TMDB, so
  it capped at "3" even though the credentials screen has six sources. It now
  reads `active/total` (e.g. `3/6`) across all six — IGDB, SteamGridDB, TMDB,
  ComicVine, Google Books and ScreenScraper — and only turns green when every
  source is configured.

  * lib/features/settings/screens/settings_screen.dart (_SettingsScreenState._apiKeyStates, _apiKeysValue, _apiKeysAllSet):
    Derive both the count and the all-set state from one six-source list.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb (settingsApiKeysValue): Change the
    string from `{count} keys` to `{active}/{total}`.

- **Moved the Steam, RetroAchievements, MyAnimeList and AniList importers onto the shared import layer**

  The four source importers now live under `lib/core/import/sources/<name>/` next
  to Kinorium and are built on the same ports-and-adapters layer: each implements
  `ImportSource`, returns a `UniversalImportResult`, and writes through
  `ImportWriter` instead of its own per-row collection / wishlist code. Writes are
  batched now (one bulk item insert, one bulk wishlist insert, one media-cache
  upsert) instead of a row at a time, and the duplicated resolve-or-create, merge,
  tally and wishlist-dedup logic is gone. Behaviour is preserved, with two
  deliberate changes: a re-seen item that needs no change is reported as "skipped"
  rather than "updated", and the import tag is no longer stamped onto pre-existing
  untagged wishlist rows.

  The import progress screens are unchanged for the user: the live per-item
  counters, the current-title line and the MyAnimeList rate-limit countdown all
  stay. They now read these off the shared `ImportProgress`, and the running
  tallies come from a per-item callback on `ImportWriter.writeItems` so the
  classification stays in one place.

  * lib/core/services/import_service.dart (ImportProgress): Added optional
    `currentItem`, `imported` / `updated` / `wishlisted` tallies and
    `retryWaitSeconds` / `retryAttempt` / `retryMaxAttempts` so source adapters
    can report the same rich progress through the shared type.
  * lib/core/import/import_writer.dart (ImportCandidate.label, ImportWriter.writeItems, ImportItemProgress):
    `ImportCandidate` carries an optional progress `label`; `writeItems` takes an
    `onItem` callback that fires per candidate with the running imported / updated
    tallies.
  * lib/core/import/import_columns.dart (epochSeconds, statusDateColumns, sumByType):
    New. Shared helpers: a status transition turned into collection_items columns
    (used by the adapters that merge an external status into a local item) and a
    per-media-type tally sum.
  * lib/core/import/sources/steam/steam_import_service.dart (SteamImportService, SteamImportOptions),
    lib/core/import/sources/anilist/anilist_import_service.dart (AniListImportService, AniListImportOptions),
    lib/core/import/sources/mal/mal_import_service.dart (MalImportService, MalImportOptions),
    lib/core/import/sources/ra/ra_import_service.dart (RaImportService, RaImportOptions):
    Reimplemented on `ImportSource` / `ImportWriter`; removed the bespoke
    `SteamImportResult` / `AniListImportResult` / `MalImportResult` /
    `RaImportResult`, their `*ImportProgress` / `*ImportStage` types and the
    `toUniversal()` extensions. RaImportService writes its `tracker_game_data`
    side-table in one batch (TrackerDao.upsertGameDataBatch) after the items.
  * lib/features/settings/content/steam_import_content.dart,
    lib/features/settings/content/anilist_import_content.dart,
    lib/features/settings/content/mal_import_content.dart,
    lib/features/settings/content/ra_import_content.dart:
    Call `import(options)` and consume `UniversalImportResult`; map the shared
    `ImportStage` to the existing localized stage labels.
  * lib/core/import/sources/steam/README.md, lib/core/import/sources/anilist/README.md,
    lib/core/import/sources/mal/README.md, lib/core/import/sources/ra/README.md:
    New per-source docs.
  * lib/core/import/README.md, docs/ARCHITECTURE.md:
    Import-layer status now lists the five adapters on the layer; only Trakt
    remains unmigrated.
  * test/core/import/sources/steam/steam_import_service_test.dart,
    test/core/import/sources/anilist/anilist_import_service_test.dart,
    test/core/import/sources/mal/mal_import_service_test.dart,
    test/core/import/sources/ra/ra_import_service_test.dart:
    Rewritten to verify repository-routed batch writes.
  * test/core/services/import_result_extensions_test.dart:
    Dropped the removed `SteamImportResult.toUniversal()` group.

- **Settings cache button now clears only unused covers instead of wiping the whole cache**

  The image-cache action no longer deletes the entire cache folder. It now
  removes only downloaded covers whose media is no longer in any collection
  (the metadata cache tables only ever grow and are never pruned, so covers
  pile up after an item or collection is deleted). Custom covers and canvas
  board images are never touched, and the success toast reports how many
  files were removed.

  * lib/core/services/cache_cleanup_service.dart (CacheCleanupService, cacheCleanupServiceProvider):
    New. Builds the keep-set from CollectionRepository.getAllItemsWithData()
    using CollectionItem.imageType and CollectionItem.coverImageId, limited to
    the re-downloadable cover folders (custom and canvas folders excluded).
  * lib/core/services/image_cache_service.dart (ImageCacheService.removeOrphans, CacheCleanupResult):
    New. Deletes `.png` files not in the keep-set per ImageType folder,
    tolerating Windows file locks. Removed the now-unused
    ImageCacheService.clearCache (full-wipe) that the button used to call.
  * lib/features/settings/content/cache_content.dart (_CacheContentState._clearCache):
    Call removeOrphans through the cleanup service and report the deleted count.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb (cacheClearCache, cacheClearCacheTitle, cacheClearCacheMessage, cacheOrphansRemoved, cacheCleared):
    Reword for the orphan-only behaviour; add cacheOrphansRemoved with a
    `{count}` placeholder; drop the now-unused cacheCleared toast string.

### Fixed

- **Search crashing on Android devices without a gyroscope**

  Opening an item's detail sheet in search threw `PlatformException(NO_SENSOR,
  ... no Gyroscope sensor)` on devices that lack a hardware gyroscope (e.g.
  Honor "Lite" models, many tablets and emulators), because the poster
  parallax subscribed to the gyroscope without handling the sensor-missing
  error. The parallax now degrades to a plain static image instead of letting
  the error surface, fixing every place the effect is used (the search detail
  sheet and the shared media detail view).

  * lib/shared/widgets/gyroscope_parallax_image.dart (GyroscopeParallaxImage, _GyroscopeParallaxImageState._onGyroscopeError):
    Add an `onError` handler (with `cancelOnError`) that cancels the
    subscription and falls back to a static image; `_ticker` becomes nullable
    and is the single "parallax active" flag, replacing the scattered
    `Platform.isAndroid` checks. Add a `@visibleForTesting` `gyroscopeStream`
    seam so the sensor path is testable off-device.

- **Folder picker crashing with "Permission denied" on some newer Android builds**

  Choosing a custom data folder failed with `PathAccessException: ... '/storage/'
  (Permission denied)` on some newer Android builds (seen on Android 16 / Pixel)
  even with "All files access" granted, while working on others (Android 10, 13):
  the volume detector listed `/storage` directly, which those builds refuse
  regardless of the permission. Storage volumes are now derived from the
  per-volume app directories instead of listing `/storage`, so detection no
  longer depends on that OEM-specific behaviour.

  * lib/core/services/storage_volumes.dart (StorageVolumes.detect,
    StorageVolumes.externalDirsProvider): Derive volume roots from
    getExternalStorageDirectories() by trimming the `/Android/data/<pkg>/files`
    suffix; no `/storage` listing. detect() is now async.
  * lib/shared/utils/storage_access.dart (pickRawFolder): Await the async
    detect() and guard the BuildContext across the gap.

- **Restore sorting by name on the collections list**

  The collections folder list lost its sort-mode picker in an earlier
  title-bar refactor — the floating action only flipped the direction, so
  there was no way to switch from date-created to alphabetical. The sort
  action now opens a dialog to choose the mode (Date Created / Name) and
  the direction together, applied only on confirm.

  * lib/features/collections/screens/home_screen.dart
    (_HomeScreenState._showSortOptions, _SortDialog, _SortChoice): New. The
    sort entry in the floating menu is relabeled "Sort" with an Icons.sort
    glyph and opens the dialog; the picked mode and direction are written
    via collectionListSortProvider.setSortMode and
    collectionListSortDescProvider.setDescending.

- **Keep user-supplied images with the data they belong to**

  Collection hero banners and custom / canvas cover images were stored
  outside the data folder, so they were lost when the folder moved or a
  custom folder was picked, and were never carried over a device-to-device
  sync. Hero images now live inside the data folder (existing ones migrate
  on first launch); LAN sync transfers the user images as a second step
  after the database (the re-downloadable cover cache is skipped — it
  re-fetches on the receiving device); and the folder copy grows an opt-in
  "copy the image cache too" checkbox for a full offline mirror.

  * lib/core/services/collection_hero_service.dart
    (CollectionHeroService.resolveRoot,
    CollectionHeroService.migrateLegacyHeroImages): Resolve `collections/`
    under the data root via StorageRoot; one-time idempotent migration of
    hero images from the legacy AppSupport location.
  * lib/core/services/storage_root.dart (StorageRoot.collectionsFolderName,
    StorageRoot.imageCacheFolderName, StorageRoot.copyDataTo,
    StorageRoot._copyTree): New folder-name constants; copyDataTo gains
    includeImages to recursively copy `collections/` and each profile's
    `image_cache/`.
  * lib/core/services/db_sync_service.dart
    (DbSyncService.buildUserImagesArchive,
    DbSyncService.applyUserImagesArchive): Zip of the hero, custom-cover and
    canvas-image folders (re-downloadable covers excluded), extracted over
    the data root on receive.
  * lib/core/services/lan_sync_service.dart (LanSyncService._serveImages,
    LanSyncService.downloadUserImages): New `/images` endpoint and client
    for the image step.
  * lib/features/settings/screens/lan_sync_screen.dart
    (_LanSyncScreenState._pull): Two-phase pull (database, then images) with
    a soft warning when the image step fails.
  * lib/features/settings/widgets/storage_location_section.dart
    (_StorageLocationSectionState._askCopyOptions): Copy dialog with the
    "copy images too" checkbox, off by default.
  * lib/core/services/image_cache_service.dart
    (ImageCacheService.getBaseCachePath): Reference
    StorageRoot.imageCacheFolderName instead of the string literal.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb (storageLocationCopyImages,
    storageLocationCopyImagesHint, lanSyncReceivingImages,
    lanSyncImagesWarning): New strings.

## [0.34.0] - 2026-06-12

### Fixed

- **AniList search and images failing with 403 "manually blocked"**

  AniList banned the default Dart User-Agent (`Dart/3.12 (dart:io)`), which
  403s every Flutter app that does not identify itself — both the GraphQL
  API and the image CDN (covers, avatars). The app now sends a descriptive
  TonkatsuBox User-Agent on every HTTP client.

  * lib/core/services/app_http_overrides.dart (AppHttpOverrides): New.
    Global HttpOverrides stamping the User-Agent onto all clients (Dio,
    NetworkImage, cached_network_image); installed in main.dart.
  * lib/core/api/anilist/anilist_graphql_client.dart
    (AniListGraphQLClient): Explicit User-Agent header as well.

### Changed

- **Skeleton loaders on the main list screens instead of spinners**

  The collection grid, wishlist, releases and the home collections list
  now show shimmer placeholders shaped like the incoming content.

  * lib/shared/widgets/shimmer_loading.dart (ShimmerList,
    ShimmerPosterGrid): New.
  * collection_screen.dart, wishlist_screen.dart, releases_screen.dart,
    home_screen.dart: Loading branches switched to the shimmer widgets.

- **Design tokens for animation durations, border radii and button heights**

  Duration, radius and button-height literals across widgets replaced
  with a shared scale; a few stray values unified along the way (tooltip
  delay, compact button heights, platform badge rounding).

  * lib/shared/theme/app_durations.dart (AppDurations): New.
  * lib/shared/theme/app_spacing.dart (AppSpacing.radiusXxs,
    AppSpacing.buttonHeight, buttonHeightCompact, buttonHeightDense): New.
  * lib/shared/theme/app_colors.dart (AppColors.brandLight,
    AppColors.brandPale): Removed — unused.

### Added

- **Network sync: pull data directly from another device on the same Wi-Fi**

  Settings → Database gains a "Network Sync" entry opening a device list.
  While the screen is open the device is discoverable on the local network;
  tapping a discovered device shows what it holds (name, date, collection
  and item counts) and, after confirmations on both sides — the receiving
  one and the serving one — replaces local data with that device's snapshot
  and offers a restart. No accounts, no cloud, no third-party tools: plain
  Wi-Fi. Transfers are refused outside private networks, a snapshot made by
  a newer app version is rejected (schema cannot be downgraded), a damaged
  transfer fails the integrity check, and a backup copy stays next to the
  database.

  * lib/core/services/lan_sync_service.dart (LanSyncService, LanPeer): New.
    UDP-broadcast discovery (port 47813, per-session instance id, peer
    expiry, unicast pong replies so devices find each other even when
    Windows broadcasts through the wrong interface or the firmware
    filters broadcasts), dart:io HttpServer serving /manifest and
    /snapshot with per-request approval and a private-network guard,
    client helpers fetchManifest and downloadSnapshot.
  * lib/core/database/sqlite_health.dart (readUserVersion, quickCheckOk):
    New. Shared schema-version and integrity probes used by both
    StorageRoot.validateDataDir and DbSyncService.inspectSnapshot.
  * lib/features/settings/screens/lan_sync_screen.dart (LanSyncScreen): New.
    Device list, pull flow with progress, incoming-request approval dialog;
    the server lives only while the screen is open.
  * lib/core/services/db_sync_service.dart (DbSyncService.buildManifest,
    DbSyncService.deviceMeta, DbSyncService.sendSnapshot): Manifest
    building and device identity made public for the server; snapshots
    fall back to a WAL checkpoint plus file copy on firmwares whose
    SQLite predates VACUUM INTO (the version is probed once up front).
  * lib/features/settings/content/database_content.dart
    (DatabaseContent.build): Network Sync entry between Data Location and
    Danger Zone.

- **One-tap restore of the database backup left by a sync**

  Settings → Database gains a "Backup" section showing when the backup next
  to the database was made; restoring swaps the live database with it, and
  since the replaced data becomes the new backup, a second restore undoes
  the first. The backup is validated (schema version, integrity) before the
  swap. This is the only recovery path on Android's default data folder,
  which file managers cannot reach. The backup file now also travels along
  when the data folder is copied to a new location.

  * lib/core/services/db_sync_service.dart (DbSyncService.backupTimestamp,
    DbSyncService.restoreBackup): New. Backup discovery without opening
    the database; validated file swap.
  * lib/features/settings/widgets/backup_section.dart (BackupSection): New.
    Settings group with the backup date and the restore flow.
  * lib/features/settings/content/database_content.dart
    (DatabaseContent.build): Mount BackupSection before Danger Zone.
  * lib/core/services/storage_root.dart (StorageRoot._copyDbFiles): Carry
    the `.bak` file when copying data to a new folder.

- **Custom data folder: the database and profiles can live in any user-picked directory**

  Settings → Database grows a "Data Location" section: pick any folder for the
  app's data (database, profiles), reset back to the default, see which folder
  is active. Picking a folder that already holds a database switches to it
  without copying — a quick way to look at another data set; picking an empty
  folder offers to copy the current data (live database flushed via WAL
  checkpoint first, image caches re-download on demand). Switching always asks
  for an app restart. A configured folder that is missing or emptied at startup
  falls back to the default location with a warning instead of crashing or
  silently creating a fresh database.

  The database found in a custom folder is validated before use — both when
  picking the folder and on every app start. A database made by a newer app
  version is refused with a clear message (schema cannot be downgraded), and
  a corrupted or half-copied file (e.g. a sync tool delivered it mid-write)
  falls back to the default location instead of crashing. This makes the
  folder-shared-via-Syncthing workflow safe.

  On Android the system SAF picker is replaced with an in-app folder browser
  over the real filesystem (the SAF URI-to-path conversion is firmware
  guesswork and produced non-existent paths on some devices); it lists all
  mounted volumes (internal storage, SD card, USB OTG) and can create folders.
  Storage permissions are handled per Android version: "All files access" on
  Android 11+ (with a system-list fallback for OEM firmwares that hide the
  per-app screen) and the classic storage permission on Android 10 and below.

  * lib/core/services/storage_root.dart (StorageRoot, StorageRootResolution,
    DataDirVerdict): New. Single resolver of the data root: custom dir from
    prefs (custom_storage_dir) with fallback to the default AppSupport
    location; validateDataDir (schema-version and integrity checks,
    memoized per session), hasData, isWritable, copyDataTo helpers; public
    dbFileName, profilesFileName, profilesFolderName constants.
  * lib/shared/utils/storage_access.dart (pickRawFolder, ensureStorageAccess,
    offerAppRestart): New. Android permission flow and raw-path folder
    picking shared between settings sections.
  * lib/core/services/db_sync_service.dart (DbSyncService),
    lib/shared/models/sync_manifest.dart (SyncManifest): New. Transport-
    agnostic database snapshot engine (send/inspect/receive) for the
    upcoming LAN sync; no UI yet.
  * lib/core/database/migrations/migration_registry.dart
    (MigrationRegistry.latestVersion): New getter backing the
    schema-version guard.
  * lib/core/services/storage_volumes.dart (StorageVolumes, StorageVolume):
    New. Detects mounted Android volumes under /storage; primaryPath getter.
  * lib/shared/widgets/folder_picker_dialog.dart (FolderPickerDialog,
    FolderPickerRoot): New. In-app folder browser with multi-volume root list,
    ".." navigation and folder creation.
  * lib/features/settings/widgets/storage_location_section.dart
    (StorageLocationSection): New. Settings group with the current path,
    change/reset buttons, copy and restart flows, per-version Android
    permission handling.
  * lib/features/settings/content/database_content.dart (DatabaseContent.build):
    Mount StorageLocationSection between Configuration and Danger Zone.
  * lib/core/database/database_service.dart (DatabaseService._initDatabase,
    DatabaseService.checkpointWal): Resolve the base path via
    StorageRoot.resolve(); new checkpointWal() flushes the WAL (logs an
    incomplete busy checkpoint) so a live database can be file-copied.
  * lib/core/services/profile_service.dart (ProfileService.getBasePath):
    Resolve via StorageRoot; layout constants now referenced from StorageRoot.
  * lib/core/services/image_cache_service.dart
    (ImageCacheService.getBaseCachePath): Default branch resolves via
    StorageRoot so profile image caches follow the data root.
  * android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml: MANAGE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE,
    legacy READ/WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE (maxSdkVersion 29),
    requestLegacyExternalStorage.
  * pubspec.yaml: Add permission_handler, android_intent_plus,
    device_info_plus.

## [0.33.0] - 2026-06-11

### Added

- **Add Fantlab as a second book provider with a similar-books row**

  Fantlab joins OpenLibrary under Books — its own search source (query search,
  narrowed by literary work type: novel / novella / short story / cycle), with
  cover, authors, rating, genres, awards and a BBCode-stripped synopsis. A
  book's detail page now shows a "Similar books" row when the work comes from
  Fantlab, the one book provider with a similars endpoint. Sparse Fantlab search
  rows are fetched in full before the details sheet opens; OpenLibrary rows stay
  instant and lazy-load only the description.

  A book's collection identity now includes its `source`, so an OpenLibrary and
  a Fantlab work that happen to share a numeric id can both sit in one
  collection (previously the second was rejected as "already in collection").

  A Fantlab work has many editions, each with its own cover. The book detail
  sheet shows an inline editions strip (grouped, covers first); picking one
  saves that edition's cover and bibliographic fields onto the book, while the
  work identity stays the same.

  * lib/core/api/fantlab/fantlab_editions.dart (FantlabEdition, FantlabEditionBlock, parseFantlabEditionBlocks), fantlab_works_api.dart (FantlabWorksApi.getEditions), fantlab_api.dart (FantlabApi.getEditions): New — parse `/work/{id}/extended` `editions_blocks` into grouped editions (covers first, `pic_num` → `hasCover`, BBCode publisher stripped).
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/fantlab_edition_picker.dart (FantlabEditionsSection, showFantlabEditionPicker, applyFantlabEdition, editionIdFromCoverUrl): New — inline editions strip and a modal grouped picker; `applyFantlabEdition` overlays cover / year / pages / isbn / language / publisher onto a book.
  * lib/shared/utils/cover_image_id.dart (coverImageId): Add `coverUrl`; a book cover is now keyed by its Fantlab edition id (`fantlab_3104_e24724`) so picking a different edition is a distinct cache entry instead of a stale overwrite. Threaded through the book cover call sites: lib/features/search/handlers/media_handlers.dart, lib/features/search/widgets/browse_grid.dart, item_details_sheet.dart, lib/features/collections/widgets/book_similars_section.dart, lib/features/tier_lists/widgets/mood_grid_cell_widget.dart, lib/shared/models/collection_item.dart, cover_info.dart, canvas_item.dart.
  * lib/features/search/widgets/fantlab_book_sheet.dart (FantlabBookSheet): New stateful host that hangs the editions strip on a Fantlab book sheet and reports the picked edition.
  * lib/features/search/widgets/item_details_sheet.dart (ItemDetailsSheet.editionsSection): New opaque inline-section slot rendered below the overview.
  * lib/features/search/handlers/media_handlers.dart (MediaHandlers): Route Fantlab book sheets through FantlabBookSheet and apply the picked edition in the add-time enrich step (tagged by work id so it only affects its own book).
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb (editionPickerTitle, editionPickerEmpty): New strings.

  * lib/core/api/fantlab_api.dart (FantlabApi, fantlabApiProvider): New REST facade — `searchWorks`, `getWork`, `getSimilars`.
  * lib/core/api/fantlab/fantlab_http_client.dart (FantlabHttpClient), fantlab_search_api.dart (FantlabSearchApi), fantlab_works_api.dart (FantlabWorksApi), fantlab_types.dart (FantlabApiException), README.md: New — Dio transport, `/search-works` (non-book types filtered out), `/work/{id}/extended`, `/work/{id}/similars`.
  * lib/shared/models/book.dart (Book.fromFantlabSearchMatch, Book.fromFantlabWork, Book.fromFantlabSimilar): New factories for the three Fantlab payload shapes, with author / language / genre / award extraction helpers.
  * lib/shared/utils/bbcode.dart (stripBbCodes): New — strips Fantlab BBCode tags from synopsis text.
  * lib/features/search/sources/fantlab_source.dart (FantlabSource): New source-first Books provider (query-only, relevance order).
  * lib/features/search/filters/fantlab_work_type_filter.dart (FantlabWorkTypeFilter): New work-type filter applied client-side by `name_eng`.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/book_similars_section.dart (BookSimilarsSection): New "Similar books" row, Fantlab-only.
  * lib/features/collections/screens/item_detail_screen.dart (_ItemDetailScreenState._addBookFromSimilars): Show the similars row for Fantlab books and add a tapped similar to a chosen collection.
  * lib/features/search/handlers/media_handlers.dart (_fetchFullBook, _enrichBook, _loadBookDescription): Per-provider full-work fetch — OpenLibrary overlays the search row, Fantlab replaces it.
  * lib/features/search/handlers/simple_media_handler.dart (SimpleMediaHandler.enrichBeforeDetails): New flag — enrich sparse rows behind a spinner before opening the details sheet.
  * lib/features/collections/helpers/collection_actions.dart (CollectionActions): Refresh a collected Fantlab book from the API.
  * lib/shared/constants/source_catalog.dart (kSearchGroupToSources): Rename from `kSearchGroupToSource` and map each search group to a `List<DataSource>` so Books carries both OpenLibrary and Fantlab.
  * lib/core/database/migrations/migration_v48.dart (MigrationV48), migration_registry.dart (MigrationRegistry.all): New migration — carve `book` out of the generic `idx_ci_*_other` unique indexes into source-aware `idx_ci_*_book` indexes.
  * lib/core/database/database_service.dart (DatabaseService._onCreate, _initDatabase): Replay MigrationV48 on fresh installs (createCollectionItemsTable is shared with the v8 upgrade path and stays untouched); bump schema version to 48.
  * lib/features/search/sources/openlibrary_source.dart (OpenLibrarySource), search_sources.dart (searchSources): Group OpenLibrary and Fantlab under the shared "Books" media label; register the Fantlab source.
  * lib/features/search/utils/filter_ui.dart (filterAccentForGroup): Use the book accent for the Fantlab group's filter bar.
  * lib/shared/models/data_source.dart (DataSource.fantlab), lib/shared/theme/app_assets.dart (AppAssets.iconFantlabColor), assets/images/icon_fantlab_color.png: Fantlab brand icon.
  * lib/features/settings/content/credits_content.dart (CreditsContent), lib/features/welcome/widgets/welcome_step_sources.dart: Fantlab attribution under Credits → Data Providers and its welcome-screen blurb.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb (searchSourceFantlab, searchSourceBooks, fantlabTypeNovel, fantlabTypeNovella, fantlabTypeShortStory, fantlabTypeCycle, bookSimilarTitle, creditsFantlabAttribution, welcomeSourceDescFantlab): New strings.
  * test/core/api/fantlab_api_test.dart, test/core/api/fantlab/fantlab_editions_test.dart, test/features/search/sources/fantlab_source_test.dart, test/features/search/filters/fantlab_work_type_filter_test.dart, test/shared/utils/bbcode_test.dart, test/features/collections/widgets/book_similars_section_test.dart, test/features/collections/widgets/fantlab_edition_picker_test.dart, test/core/database/migrations/migration_v48_test.dart: New tests.
  * test/shared/models/book_test.dart, test/shared/constants/source_catalog_test.dart, test/features/search/sources/search_sources_test.dart, search_sources_grouping_test.dart, source_output_media_type_test.dart: Cover the Fantlab factories, multi-source groups, and Fantlab source registration.
  * test/helpers/mocks.dart (MockFantlabApi): New mock.

- **Expand VNDB search filters**

  The Visual Novels tab grows from one filter (tag) to six: tags become
  multi-select, plus length, language availability, release year, minimum
  rating and an "has anime adaptation" toggle. Tags are AND-ed, languages
  OR-ed, all backed by VNDB's native filter combinators.

  * lib/core/api/vndb/vndb_vn_api.dart (VndbVnApi.browseVn), lib/core/api/vndb_api.dart (VndbApi.browseVn): Replace `tagId` with `tagIds` (multi) and add `length`, `langs`, `startYear`, `endYear`, `minRating`, `hasAnime`; build the `['and', ...]` filter array (languages as a nested `['or', ...]`, year as `released` bounds).
  * lib/features/search/filters/vndb_length_filter.dart (VndbLengthFilter), vndb_language_filter.dart (VndbLanguageFilter), vndb_min_rating_filter.dart (VndbMinRatingFilter), vndb_has_anime_filter.dart (VndbHasAnimeFilter): New filters.
  * lib/features/search/filters/vndb_tag_filter.dart (VndbTagFilter): Now `multiSelect` + `searchable`.
  * lib/features/search/sources/vndb_source.dart (VndbSource.filters, VndbSource.fetch): Wire the new filters and map their values onto `browseVn`.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb (browseFilterLength, vndbLengthVeryShort, vndbLengthShort, vndbLengthMedium, vndbLengthLong, vndbLengthVeryLong, browseFilterAnimeAdaptation, vndbHasAnimeAdaptation): New filter strings.
  * test/core/api/vndb_api_test.dart: Cover the new `browseVn` filter-array building (tags, length, languages OR, year bounds, minRating, hasAnime).

- **Add books as a new media type with OpenLibrary search**

  Books join games / movies / … as `MediaType.book`, backed by a `books_cache`
  table and the keyless OpenLibrary catalog. Search by everything / title /
  author / subject, filter by language, sort by relevance / rating / newest;
  open a result for cover, authors, rating and a lazily-loaded description, then
  add it to any collection. Identity mirrors manga — the cache key is
  `(id, source)` — so a future second provider (Fantlab) with a shared numeric
  id never collides. Detail / import round-trip land in later stages.

  * lib/shared/models/book.dart (Book): New model — `fromOpenLibrarySearchDoc`, `fromOpenLibraryWork`, `fromDb`, `toDb`, `toExport`, `fromExport`, `copyWith`, `withWorkDetails`, `externalIdInt`.
  * lib/core/api/openlibrary_api.dart (OpenLibraryApi, openLibraryApiProvider): New REST facade — `search`, `getWork`.
  * lib/core/api/openlibrary/openlibrary_http_client.dart (OpenLibraryHttpClient), openlibrary_types.dart (OpenLibraryApiException), openlibrary_search_api.dart (OpenLibrarySearchApi), openlibrary_works_api.dart (OpenLibraryWorksApi), README.md: New — Dio transport (required User-Agent), `search.json` with scoped fields, `/works` + `/ratings` + `/authors` enrichment.
  * lib/core/api/api_error_extract.dart (extractApiError): Recognise OpenLibraryApiException so its copyable detail reaches the shared error UI.
  * lib/features/search/sources/openlibrary_source.dart (OpenLibrarySource), search_sources.dart (searchSources): New "Books" search source; ≥3-char query guard.
  * lib/features/search/filters/openlibrary_scope_filter.dart (OpenLibraryScopeFilter), openlibrary_language_filter.dart (OpenLibraryLanguageFilter): New — search-field scope and MARC language filters.
  * lib/features/search/utils/filter_ui.dart (filterAccentForGroup): Use the book accent for the Books group's filter bar.
  * lib/features/settings/content/credits_content.dart (CreditsContent), lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb (creditsOpenLibraryAttribution): Add the Open Library attribution (CC0 / ODbL) under Credits → Data Providers.
  * lib/features/search/models/search_source.dart (BrowseSortOption.label): Add the `relevance` sort label.
  * lib/features/search/widgets/browse_grid.dart (BrowseGrid): Render `Book` results and track collected book ids.
  * lib/features/search/widgets/item_details_sheet.dart (ItemDetailsSheet.book, ItemDetailsSheet.overviewLoader): Book quick-look with a spinner-backed lazy description.
  * lib/features/search/handlers/media_handlers.dart (MediaHandlers), simple_media_handler.dart (SimpleMediaHandler.enrich): Dispatch book taps / adds; enrich the cached row with the full work behind a blocking spinner on add.
  * lib/features/collections/helpers/collection_actions.dart (CollectionActions): Refresh a collected OpenLibrary book from the API.
  * lib/shared/widgets/loading_overlay.dart (withBlockingSpinner): New reusable modal-spinner helper for slow awaited steps.
  * lib/shared/models/data_source.dart (DataSource.openLibrary.iconAsset), lib/shared/theme/app_assets.dart (AppAssets.iconOpenLibraryColor), assets/images/open_library_color.png: OpenLibrary brand icon.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb (searchSourceOpenLibrary, searchHintBooks, bookFilterLanguage, bookFilterSearchBy, bookSearchTitle, bookSearchAuthor, bookSearchSubject, browseSortRelevance): New search strings.
  * lib/core/database/dao/book_dao.dart (BookDao): New DAO — `upsertBook`, `upsertBooks`, `getBook`, `getBooksByIds` (matches `CAST(id AS INTEGER)`), `clearBooks`.
  * lib/core/database/schema.dart (DatabaseSchema.createBooksCacheTable): New `books_cache` table, primary key `(id, source)`, title index.
  * lib/core/database/migrations/migration_v47.dart (MigrationV47): New migration creating `books_cache`.
  * lib/core/database/migrations/migration_registry.dart (MigrationRegistry.all): Register MigrationV47.
  * lib/core/database/database_service.dart (DatabaseService.bookDao, bookDaoProvider, DatabaseService.clearAllData): Wire BookDao, bump schema version to 47, flush `books_cache` on reset.
  * lib/core/database/dao/collection_dao.dart (CollectionDao._loadJoinedData, CollectionDao.getCollectionCovers, CollectionDao.getCollectionItemStats): Join `books_cache`, hydrate `item.book`, count books.
  * lib/data/repositories/canvas_repository.dart (CanvasRepository._enrichItemsWithMediaData, CanvasRepository.initializeCanvas), lib/features/collections/providers/game_canvas_provider.dart (GameCanvasNotifier._initializeWithCollectionItem): Hydrate book covers on the collection and per-item canvases.
  * lib/data/repositories/collection_repository.dart (CollectionStats.bookCount): New count.
  * lib/core/services/export_service.dart (ExportService._collectMediaData): Emit a `books` section in `.xcoll` / `.xcollx`.
  * lib/core/services/import_service.dart (ImportService._restoreMedia): Restore the embedded `books` section into `books_cache`; without it, books came back as "Unknown book" after an import / backup restore.
  * lib/shared/models/data_source.dart (DataSource.openLibrary, DataSource.fantlab): New sources.
  * lib/shared/models/media_type.dart (MediaType.book): New media type.
  * lib/shared/models/collection_item.dart (CollectionItem.book), lib/shared/models/canvas_item.dart (CanvasItem.book, CanvasItemType.book): Carry the joined book payload.
  * lib/shared/utils/cover_image_id.dart (coverImageId), lib/core/services/image_cache_service.dart (ImageType.bookCover): Namespace book covers by source (`openLibrary_27448`).
  * lib/shared/constants/media_type_theme.dart (MediaTypeTheme.bookColor), lib/shared/theme/app_colors.dart (AppColors.bookAccent): Book accent colour and icon.
  * lib/features/collections/providers/collections_provider.dart (collectedBookIdsProvider): New collected-ids provider.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_filter_bar.dart (CollectionFilterBar), lib/features/home/screens/all_items_screen.dart (AllItemsScreen): Add a "Books" entry to the media-type chevron filter.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb (mediaTypeBook, collectionFilterBooks, allItemsBooks): New labels.
  * lib/core/services/discord_rpc_service.dart, lib/core/services/text_export_service.dart, lib/features/collections/helpers/bulk_operations.dart, lib/features/collections/helpers/collection_actions.dart, lib/features/collections/screens/item_detail_screen.dart, lib/features/collections/widgets/canvas_item_actions.dart, lib/features/collections/widgets/canvas_view.dart, lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_filter_bar.dart, lib/features/collections/widgets/item_detail/item_detail_media_config.dart, lib/features/home/screens/all_items_screen.dart, lib/features/releases/screens/releases_screen.dart, lib/features/search/screens/search_screen.dart, lib/features/tier_lists/widgets/mood_grid_cell_media.dart, lib/features/wishlist/screens/wishlist_screen.dart, lib/shared/models/cover_info.dart: Propagate `MediaType.book` / `CanvasItemType.book` through exhaustive switches.

- **Track reading progress for books by page**

  A book's detail page gains a reading-progress block (like manga / anime):
  current page out of the total from OpenLibrary, with a +1 button and
  tap-to-edit. Status auto-syncs — past page 0 it becomes In progress, at the
  last page Completed, back to 0 resets to Not started, and Dropped is left
  alone. With no known page count it acts as a plain bookmark (page number, no
  bar, no auto-complete). The page read reuses the existing `current_episode`
  column, so no migration.

  * lib/features/collections/widgets/book_progress_section.dart (BookProgressSection): New — pages row built on `MediaProgressRow`, writing through `updateProgress(currentEpisode:)`.
  * lib/features/collections/providers/collections_provider.dart (CollectionItemsNotifier.updateProgress, CollectionItemsNotifier._autoUpdateBookStatus): New auto-status helper for books, gated on `MediaType.book`, total from `Book.pageCount`.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/item_detail/item_detail_media_config.dart (ItemDetailMediaConfig.hasBookProgress, ItemDetailMediaConfig.book): Carry the book payload and the progress flag.
  * lib/features/collections/screens/item_detail_screen.dart: Render BookProgressSection inside a collection.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb (bookProgress, bookPages, bookMarkCompleted): New strings.
  * test/helpers/builders.dart (createTestCollectionItem): Accept a `book` argument.

### Changed

- **Steam import writes playtime to the time-spent field instead of user notes**

  The import used to stamp "Steam: 12.3h" into the item's personal notes,
  overwriting whatever the user had written there on every re-import. Playtime
  now lands in the dedicated time-spent field shown in the item card (the
  write is skipped when the value hasn't changed), and the import no longer
  touches notes at all — a wishlist row keeps its note too and only gets the
  import tag stamped when it was untagged.

  * lib/core/services/steam_import_service.dart (SteamImportService.importLibrary, SteamImportService._updateExistingItem): Write `playtimeMinutes` via `updateItemTimeSpent` instead of `updateItemUserComment`; skip the write when unchanged.
  * lib/core/services/steam_import_service.dart (SteamImportService._addToWishlist): Drop the "Steam: Xh" note on wishlist rows; remove `_formatPlaytime`.
  * test/helpers/builders.dart (createTestCollectionItem): Add `timeSpentMinutes`.
  * test/core/services/steam_import_service_test.dart: Cover the time-spent writes, the unchanged-value skip, and that notes are never touched.

- **Extract the shared filter-value reader used by the search sources**

  Four search sources carried an identical private `_readStringList` helper;
  it now lives in one place.

  * lib/features/search/utils/filter_value_utils.dart (readFilterStringList): New — coerces a multi-select filter value to `List<String>`.
  * lib/features/search/sources/anilist_anime_source.dart, anilist_manga_source.dart, mangabaka_source.dart, vndb_source.dart: Drop the private copy, use `readFilterStringList`.
  * test/features/search/utils/filter_value_utils_test.dart: New.

- **Decompose the TMDB client into a `tmdb/` submodule**

  The 1123-line `TmdbApi` god-class is split into a thin facade over a transport
  client and focused sub-clients (movies, TV, genres, reviews, cross-type find),
  matching the existing `igdb/` / `anilist/` / `openlibrary/` layout. Behaviour
  and the public API are unchanged — the facade re-exports the same types and
  delegates every method, so callers and mocks are untouched.

  * lib/core/api/tmdb_api.dart (TmdbApi, tmdbApiProvider): Now a facade that wires the sub-clients, delegates every public method, and coordinates genre-cache invalidation on `setLanguage` / `clearApiKey`; re-exports `tmdb/tmdb_types.dart`.
  * lib/core/api/tmdb/tmdb_http_client.dart (TmdbHttpClient): New — Dio transport owning the API key and request language, injecting both into `get`, plus `validateApiKey`, `extractResults`, `ensureApiKey`, and Dio → `TmdbApiException` mapping.
  * lib/core/api/tmdb/tmdb_types.dart (TmdbApiException, TmdbPagedResult, TmdbFindResult, TmdbGenre, TmdbMediaType, MultiSearchResult): New — DTOs and the exception moved out of the facade.
  * lib/core/api/tmdb/tmdb_genres_api.dart (TmdbGenresApi): New — genre catalogs plus the per-language id→name cache and `resolveGenreIds`; `setCacheForTesting` backs the facade's `setGenreCacheForTesting`.
  * lib/core/api/tmdb/tmdb_movies_api.dart (TmdbMoviesApi), tmdb_tv_api.dart (TmdbTvApi): New — movie / TV search, detail, lists and discover (TV also seasons / episodes).
  * lib/core/api/tmdb/tmdb_reviews_api.dart (TmdbReviewsApi): New — `getMovieReviews` / `getTvReviews`, pinned to en-US.
  * lib/core/api/tmdb/tmdb_find_api.dart (TmdbFindApi): New — `findByImdbId` / `findByTvdbId` and `multiSearch`.
  * lib/core/api/tmdb/README.md: New — layer table and key points.

- **Decompose the RA, VNDB, SteamGridDB and MangaBaka clients into submodules**

  The four remaining single-file API clients are split into thin facades over a
  transport client plus focused sub-clients, matching the existing `igdb/` /
  `anilist/` / `tmdb/` layout. Behaviour and the public API are unchanged — each
  facade re-exports the same types and delegates every method, so callers and
  mocks are untouched. `RaApi` and `MangaBakaApi` also gain a `dispose()` for
  consistency. MangaBaka, previously untested, gets its own unit suite.

  * lib/core/api/ra_api.dart (RaApi, raApiProvider): Now a facade over `ra/`; re-exports `ra/ra_types.dart`; adds `dispose`.
  * lib/core/api/ra/ra_http_client.dart (RaHttpClient): New — Dio transport with `z`/`y` credential state injected into `get`, `validateCredentials`, `handleError`.
  * lib/core/api/ra/ra_types.dart (RaApiException, RaGameListEntry), ra_user_api.dart (RaUserApi), ra_games_api.dart (RaGamesApi), README.md: New — types, user calls (`getUserProfile`, `getCompletedGames`, `getUserAwardDates`), game calls (`getGameSummary`, `getGameInfoAndUserProgress`, `getGameList`).
  * lib/core/api/vndb_api.dart (VndbApi, vndbApiProvider): Now a facade over `vndb/`; re-exports `vndb/vndb_types.dart`.
  * lib/core/api/vndb/vndb_http_client.dart (VndbHttpClient), vndb_types.dart (VndbApiException), vndb_vn_api.dart (VndbVnApi), vndb_tags_api.dart (VndbTagsApi), README.md: New — `post` transport, `/vn` queries (`searchVn`, `browseVn`, `getVnById`, `getVnByIds`), `/tag` catalog (`fetchTags`).
  * lib/core/api/steamgriddb_api.dart (SteamGridDbApi, steamGridDbApiProvider): Now a facade over `steamgriddb/`; re-exports `steamgriddb/steamgriddb_types.dart`.
  * lib/core/api/steamgriddb/steamgriddb_http_client.dart (SteamGridDbHttpClient), steamgriddb_types.dart (SteamGridDbApiException), steamgriddb_games_api.dart (SteamGridDbGamesApi), steamgriddb_images_api.dart (SteamGridDbImagesApi), README.md: New — Bearer-auth `get`, `searchGames`, `getGrids` / `getHeroes` / `getLogos` / `getIcons`.
  * lib/core/api/mangabaka_api.dart (MangaBakaApi, mangaBakaApiProvider): Now a facade over `mangabaka/`; re-exports `mangabaka/mangabaka_types.dart`; adds `dispose`.
  * lib/core/api/mangabaka/mangabaka_http_client.dart (MangaBakaHttpClient), mangabaka_types.dart (MangaBakaApiException), mangabaka_manga_api.dart (MangaBakaMangaApi), mangabaka_tags_api.dart (MangaBakaTagsApi), README.md: New — `get` transport, `browseManga` / `getById`, `fetchTagCatalog`.
  * test/core/api/mangabaka_api_test.dart: New — covers `browseManga` (pagination, malformed-skip), `getById` (success / null / 404 / error), `fetchTagCatalog` (parse, malformed-skip, error) and Dio error mapping.

- **Redesign the first-run Welcome wizard**

  The wizard becomes five cinematic steps — Welcome → Language → Name →
  Sources → an interactive menu tour. The intro no longer mentions API keys.
  The old API-keys and "how it works" steps fold into a single Sources step
  that lists every search provider with its logo, media types and key status,
  and takes IGDB / TMDB keys inline — framed as optional, since a built-in key
  works out of the box and a personal key only raises rate limits. The final
  step launches a coachmark over the real app: it dims the shell and spotlights
  each live navigation button in turn — the rail or bottom bar, plus the
  Settings gear — with a description card beside it. Settings → Credits gains
  the same branded provider cards. The default content language now follows the
  English UI default (en-US).

  * lib/features/welcome/screens/welcome_screen.dart (WelcomeScreen): Five-step flow [Intro, Language, Name, Sources, MenuTour]; hides the global nav on the tour step; `_finish({startTour})` starts the menu tour as it reveals the shell.
  * lib/features/welcome/widgets/welcome_step_sources.dart (WelcomeStepSources, _SourceCard, _KeyEditor, _KeyBadge, _GetKeyLink): New — provider cards from `kDataSourceCatalog` with inline IGDB / TMDB key entry and an "optional, raises limits, works without it" hint.
  * lib/features/welcome/widgets/welcome_step_menu_tour.dart (WelcomeStepMenuTour): New — the final step is a short intro whose Start button finishes the wizard and kicks off the menu tour (Skip finishes without it).
  * lib/features/welcome/widgets/menu_tour_overlay.dart (MenuTourOverlay): New — the coachmark itself, drawn over AppShell; reads each real button's render box (after layout, not during build) to dim + spotlight it and anchor a description card that flips to the side with room; taps and Next advance, Skip / the last step end it.
  * lib/features/welcome/widgets/menu_tour_items.dart (MenuTourItem, buildMenuTourItems): New — tour items derived from `NavTab.values` so they always match the real menu (six destinations plus the Settings gear).
  * lib/shared/navigation/nav_tour_keys.dart (NavTourKeys, navTourKeysProvider): New — one shared GlobalKey per NavTab, attached to the live nav buttons so the tour can locate them on screen.
  * lib/features/welcome/providers/menu_tour_provider.dart (MenuTourController, menuTourControllerProvider): New — toggles the tour overlay; lives in the root scope so it survives the wizard→shell route swap.
  * lib/shared/navigation/app_shell.dart (_AppShellState._buildShell): Layer MenuTourOverlay over the shell while the tour controller is on.
  * lib/shared/navigation/app_sidebar.dart (AppSidebar), lib/shared/navigation/app_bottom_bar.dart (AppBottomBar), lib/shared/navigation/app_top_bar.dart (_SettingsButton): Tag each real nav button with its `navTourKeysProvider` key.
  * lib/features/welcome/widgets/welcome_step_intro.dart (WelcomeStepIntro), welcome_step_name.dart (WelcomeStepName), welcome_step_language.dart (WelcomeStepLanguage): Cinematic restyle; intro drops the API-keys block and adds the Books media chip.
  * lib/features/settings/providers/settings_provider.dart (SettingsKeys.tmdbLanguageDefault): Default content language en-US (was ru-RU) to match the English UI default.
  * lib/shared/constants/source_catalog.dart (kDataSourceCatalog): IGDB key is recommended, not required — the built-in key works without it.
  * lib/features/welcome/widgets/welcome_card.dart (WelcomeCard), welcome_chip.dart (WelcomeChip), welcome_hero.dart (WelcomeHero), welcome_reveal.dart (WelcomeReveal): New shared step building blocks (gradient accent card, pill, glowing header, staggered reveal).
  * lib/shared/constants/source_catalog.dart (SourceInfo, SourceKeyRequirement, kDataSourceCatalog, kSearchGroupToSource): New — single source of truth mirroring the search screen's providers (TMDB, IGDB, AniList, MangaBaka, VNDB, OpenLibrary).
  * lib/shared/widgets/source_logo.dart (SourceLogo): New — brand logo with a colored-monogram fallback.
  * lib/features/settings/content/credits_content.dart (CreditsContent, _ProviderCard, _MediaTag): Branded provider cards with logos and media-type chips.
  * lib/features/welcome/widgets/welcome_step_api_keys.dart, welcome_step_how_it_works.dart, welcome_step_ready.dart: Removed — folded into the Sources step and the menu tour.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb (welcomeStepSources, welcomeStepTour, welcomeChipBooks, welcomeSourcesTitle, welcomeSourcesSubtitle, welcomeSourcesNoKeyNeeded, welcomeSourcesKeySaved, welcomeSourcesGetKey, welcomeSourcesKeyOptionalHint, welcomeSourceDescTmdb, welcomeSourceDescIgdb, welcomeSourceDescAniList, welcomeSourceDescMangaBaka, welcomeSourceDescVndb, welcomeSourceDescOpenLibrary, welcomeTourTitle, welcomeTourSubtitle, welcomeTourStart, welcomeHowReleasesDesc): New wizard strings; welcomeSubtitle and welcomeFeatureSearch now mention books.

### Fixed

- **Stop the duplicate-GlobalKey crash when resetting the database**

  Resetting the database (Settings → Database) recreates the app shell with
  `pushReplacement`, so two shells were briefly alive at once. The navigation
  buttons carried stable app-wide GlobalKeys (used only by the welcome menu
  tour), and the two shells reused them, crashing the widget tree. The tour
  keys are now attached only while the menu tour is running.

  * lib/shared/navigation/app_bottom_bar.dart (AppBottomBar.build), app_sidebar.dart (AppSidebar.build), app_top_bar.dart (_AppTopBarState.build): Gate `tourKeys.keyFor(tab)` behind `menuTourControllerProvider`.
  * test/shared/navigation/app_bottom_bar_tour_keys_test.dart: New — two bars coexist without a duplicate-key crash when the tour is off; keys attached while it runs.

- **Offer every media type when creating a custom item**

  The custom-item dialog's type chooser was a hardcoded list that had silently
  fallen behind the enum — Anime and Book were missing. It now derives from
  `MediaType.values`, so every type (and any future one) is selectable as a
  custom card's display type.

  * lib/features/collections/widgets/create_custom_item_dialog.dart (_CreateCustomItemDialogState._buildMediaTypeChips): Build the chip list from `MediaType.values` (custom first) instead of a fixed list.
  * test/features/collections/widgets/create_custom_item_dialog_test.dart: Guard test asserting one chip per `MediaType.values`.

- **Stop the soft keyboard from popping up unprompted on mobile**

  On Android, opening search from a collection, and opening any searchable
  filter, auto-focused their text field and slid the keyboard up before the
  user tapped to type. Auto-focus is now desktop-only; on mobile the keyboard
  waits until the field is tapped.

  * lib/features/search/screens/search_screen.dart (_SearchScreenState.build), lib/features/search/widgets/filter_dropdown.dart (SearchableFilterDialogState.build): Gate `TextField.autofocus` on `!kIsMobile`.
  * lib/features/search/widgets/platform_filter_sheet.dart (_PlatformFilterSheetState.initState): Skip the `requestFocus` post-frame callback on mobile.

- Mood grid PNG export no longer cuts off the right edge; the caption-template dialog no longer overflows on phones with the keyboard open (lib/features/tier_lists/widgets/mood_grid_export_view.dart, lib/features/tier_lists/screens/mood_grid_detail_screen.dart).

- Notes on an item's detail page now autosave when leaving the screen via back navigation, without crashing (lib/features/collections/screens/item_detail_screen.dart).

- The "add books" hint on an empty wishlist opened the Movies search tab instead of Books (lib/features/wishlist/screens/wishlist_screen.dart).

- Redesign the landing page to match the app's design system (docs/index.html).

## [0.32.1] - 2026-06-07

### Fixed

- **Fix the app freezing on the splash logo when an old database upgrades across many versions at once**

  `create*Table` in the schema is shared between fresh installs and the
  migration that first created the table, so columns and indexes added later
  were baked into both. A big-version-jump upgrade ran the create (with today's
  schema) and then the historical `ALTER` / `CREATE INDEX` on top, throwing
  `duplicate column name` / `index already exists`; the upgrade rolled back and
  the splash hung forever. Every column-add is now idempotent and every
  migration index uses `IF NOT EXISTS`, so the final schema is unchanged but
  redundant re-adds become no-ops.

  * lib/core/database/migrations/migration.dart (Migration.addColumnIfAbsent): New guarded column-add helper.
  * lib/core/database/migrations/migration_v4.dart, migration_v9.dart, migration_v11.dart, migration_v12.dart, migration_v15.dart, migration_v21.dart, migration_v29.dart, migration_v32.dart, migration_v34.dart, migration_v35.dart, migration_v37.dart, migration_v39.dart, migration_v40.dart, migration_v41.dart, migration_v43.dart, migration_v44.dart (MigrationV44._addCollectionItemsSource, MigrationV44._addMoodGridCellsSource): Route every `ADD COLUMN` through `Migration.addColumnIfAbsent`.
  * lib/core/database/migrations/migration_v3.dart, migration_v9.dart, migration_v17.dart, migration_v30.dart, migration_v44.dart: `CREATE INDEX` / `CREATE UNIQUE INDEX` → `IF NOT EXISTS`.

### Added

- **Show fatal startup errors on screen instead of a frozen splash**

  When a startup step fails (a failed migration, a throw before the first
  frame), the details and stack trace now paint over the UI with a Copy button,
  so a release device can be diagnosed without a logcat connection.

  * lib/core/logging/startup_error.dart (startupError, recordStartupError, StartupErrorInfo, StartupErrorView, StartupErrorApp): New on-screen startup-error reporter.
  * lib/main.dart (main): Catch a `_loadAppState` crash and show the standalone error screen; record unhandled zone errors.
  * lib/core/logging/app_logger.dart (AppLogger.setupErrorHandlers): Record unhandled platform errors.
  * lib/app.dart (TonkatsuBoxApp.build): Overlay the captured error over the running UI.
  * lib/features/splash/screens/splash_screen.dart (_SplashScreenState.initState): Capture a failed database open instead of hanging on the logo.

## [0.32.0] - 2026-06-05

### Added

- **Add any item to the calendar with a date and recurrence**

  A bell on every item's detail screen opens an add dialog (pick a date,
  pre-filled with the item's future release date, plus a repeat option: once,
  weekly or monthly). The entry then shows on the Releases calendar. TV shows
  and anime keep episode tracking; everything else (movies, games, manga, visual
  novels, custom) uses these manual entries. Past one-time entries are pruned
  when the calendar opens; recurring entries roll forward up to a year.

  * lib/shared/models/calendar_entry.dart (CalendarEntry), lib/shared/models/calendar_recurrence.dart (CalendarRecurrence): New models.
  * lib/core/database/migrations/migration_v46.dart (MigrationV46), lib/core/database/migrations/migration_registry.dart, lib/core/database/schema.dart (DatabaseSchema.createCalendarEntriesTable), lib/core/database/database_service.dart (calendarEntryDao, calendarEntryDaoProvider): New `calendar_entries` table; DB version 45 → 46.
  * lib/core/database/dao/calendar_entry_dao.dart (CalendarEntryDao): isAdded, upsert, remove, getAll, deletePastOnce, deleteOrphaned.
  * lib/core/database/dao/tracked_release_dao.dart (TrackedReleaseDao.deleteOrphaned): Drop calendar entries / release subscriptions once their item leaves every collection (kept by identity, so not FK-cascaded).
  * lib/features/collections/providers/collections_provider.dart (CollectionsNotifier.delete, CollectionsNotifier.removeItem, CollectionsNotifier._pruneCalendarOrphans): Prune orphaned calendar entries and refresh the calendar after a collection or item is deleted.
  * lib/features/releases/widgets/add_to_calendar_dialog.dart (showAddToCalendarDialog, AddToCalendarResult, _AddToCalendarDialogState._pickDate): New date + recurrence dialog; date picked via the shared dual date picker (calendar + manual input).
  * lib/features/releases/providers/releases_provider.dart (ReleasesNotifier, isCalendarEntryProvider): Merge manual entries into the calendar, expanding recurrence; prune past one-time entries on build. Resolve each entry's title / poster from the hydrated collection item.
  * lib/core/database/dao/collection_dao.dart (CollectionDao.findCollectionItemWithData): Find an item by identity with its media model joined, so the calendar shows real titles / posters instead of an "Unknown" fallback.
  * lib/features/releases/models/release_event.dart (ReleaseEvent): season / episode now nullable for manual entries; carries imageType / cacheImageId for poster caching.
  * lib/features/releases/screens/releases_screen.dart (_ReleasesScreenState._thumb, _ReleasesScreenState._placeholderIcon): Posters use the on-disk image cache instead of a raw network fetch; placeholder icon now matches the media type.
  * lib/features/collections/screens/item_detail_screen.dart (_ItemDetailScreenState), lib/features/collections/widgets/item_detail/item_detail_app_bar.dart (ItemDetailAppBar): Bell on all media types — episodes for TV / anime, manual calendar entry otherwise.
  * lib/features/settings/content/database_content.dart (_resetDatabase): Invalidate releasesProvider on database reset so the calendar clears.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb (calendarAdd, calendarRemove, calendarAddTitle, calendarDate, calendarRepeat, calendarAddAction, recurrenceOnce, recurrenceWeekly, recurrenceMonthly): New strings.

- **Back up the calendar and episode watch progress**

  Backups now include `tracked_releases` and `calendar_entries` (calendar.json),
  both keyed by item identity, and `watched_episodes` (watched_episodes.json).
  Watch progress is stored per show and re-applied on restore to whichever
  restored collections hold that show.

  * lib/core/services/backup_service.dart (BackupService.createBackup, BackupService.restoreFromBackup): Write / read `calendar.json` and `watched_episodes.json`; backup format version 2 → 3.
  * lib/core/database/dao/tv_show_dao.dart (TvShowDao.getAllWatchedEpisodes, TvShowDao.markEpisodeWatchedAt): Read all watch progress for backup; restore with an explicit timestamp.
  * lib/features/settings/screens/settings_screen.dart: Invalidate releasesProvider after restore so the calendar and nav badge refresh without reopening the tab.

- **Split Releases into "All releases" and "Calendar" tabs**

  Releases opens on an "All releases" list that groups every tracked title by
  day, oldest first. The "Calendar" tab keeps the month / week / day views
  (now defaulting to week); its title bar is tappable to jump to any date via
  the full date picker instead of only stepping with the arrows.

  * lib/features/releases/screens/releases_screen.dart (_ReleasesScreenState, _ReleasesTab, _ReleasesScreenState._calendarBody, _ReleasesScreenState._allReleasesBody, _ReleasesScreenState._pickJumpDate): Top-level All / Calendar tabs; default week view; tap the nav title to open the calendar picker and jump.
  * lib/shared/widgets/segmented_pill.dart (SegmentedPill, SegmentedPillOption): New shared pill switcher matching the item-detail status row; used for both Releases switchers.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb (releasesTabCalendar, releasesTabAll): New strings.

- **Add a Releases calendar for tracked TV shows and anime**

  A new "Releases" tab (between tier lists and wishlist) shows a
  Google-Calendar-style view of upcoming episodes for shows tracked with the
  bell in the detail screen. Month grid plus week and day agendas (no hour grid
  — episodes have no air time); today and future episodes are shown, with a
  long-press / right-click preview and tap-through to the item. Dates use the
  Settings date format. Tracking is keyed by `(external_id, source, media_type)`
  so one show counts once across collections, and a show stays on the calendar
  only while it remains in at least one collection. A refresh button (and
  pull-to-refresh on the day / week lists) re-fetches seasons from TMDB to pick
  up newly announced episodes. The navigation bell shows a badge with how many
  episodes air today.

  * lib/core/database/migrations/migration_v45.dart (MigrationV45), lib/core/database/migrations/migration_registry.dart, lib/core/database/database_service.dart (trackedReleaseDao, trackedReleaseDaoProvider): New `tracked_releases` table; DB version 44 → 45.
  * lib/core/database/schema.dart (DatabaseSchema.createTrackedReleasesTable): New table DDL.
  * lib/core/database/dao/tracked_release_dao.dart (TrackedReleaseDao): subscribe, unsubscribe, isTracked, getAll, getTrackedKeys.
  * lib/core/database/dao/tv_show_dao.dart (TvShowDao.getWatchedEpisodesForShow): Watched episodes aggregated across all collections.
  * lib/shared/models/tracked_release.dart (TrackedRelease): New model.
  * lib/features/releases/models/release_event.dart (ReleaseEvent, ReleasesCalendarData), lib/features/releases/providers/releases_provider.dart (ReleasesNotifier, ReleasesNotifier.refreshFromApi, releasesProvider, isReleaseTrackedProvider, releasesTodayCountProvider), lib/features/releases/screens/releases_screen.dart (ReleasesScreen), lib/features/releases/widgets/releases_empty_state.dart (ReleasesEmptyState): New calendar feature.
  * lib/features/collections/providers/collections_provider.dart (CollectionItemsNotifier.removeItem): Invalidate the releases calendar when an item is removed.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/item_detail/item_detail_app_bar.dart (ItemDetailAppBar), lib/features/collections/screens/item_detail_screen.dart (_ItemDetailScreenState): Bell to track / untrack releases for TMDB TV and anime.
  * lib/shared/navigation/nav_tab.dart (NavTab.releases), lib/shared/navigation/nav_destinations.dart (buildNavDestinations), lib/shared/navigation/app_shell.dart, lib/shared/navigation/search_providers.dart, lib/shared/navigation/app_bottom_bar.dart, lib/shared/navigation/app_sidebar.dart: New tab wired into navigation before wishlist, with a today-count badge on the bell.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb (navReleases, releasesEmpty, releasesEmptyHint, releasesTrackShow, releasesUntrackShow, releasesViewDay, releasesViewWeek, releasesViewMonth, releasesToday, releasesRefresh, releasesNoEpisodes, releasesEpisode): New strings.
  * pubspec.yaml (calendar_view): New MIT dependency for the month / week / day calendar.

- **Add MangaBaka as a second manga search source**

  A new MangaBaka tab in search, alongside AniList manga. MangaBaka is an open
  catalog of manga / manhwa / manhua / light novels (no anime). Filters are
  dropdowns: type, genre, tag, release status and content rating. Genres are a
  fixed seeded list; the ~2700-entry tag catalog loads on demand and has a
  manual Refresh button right in the tag picker. Genres and tags are cached in
  SQLite.

  * lib/core/api/mangabaka_api.dart (MangaBakaApi.browseManga, MangaBakaApi.getById, MangaBakaApi.fetchTagCatalog, mangaBakaApiProvider): New REST client.
  * lib/shared/models/manga.dart (Manga.fromMangaBaka): Map MangaBaka's flat record (string chapter/volume counts, 0–100 rating, raw cover, status/type vocabulary) to the shared `Manga`.
  * lib/shared/models/mangabaka_tag.dart (MangaBakaTag), lib/shared/models/mangabaka_genre.dart (MangaBakaGenre): New catalog models.
  * lib/core/database/schema.dart (DatabaseSchema.createMangaBakaGenresTable, DatabaseSchema.createMangaBakaTagsTable), lib/core/database/dao/mangabaka_genre_dao.dart (MangaBakaGenreDao), lib/core/database/dao/mangabaka_tag_dao.dart (MangaBakaTagDao): New tables and DAOs.
  * lib/data/repositories/mangabaka_tags_repository.dart (MangaBakaTagsRepository, mangaBakaTagsProvider), lib/data/repositories/mangabaka_genres_repository.dart (mangaBakaGenresProvider): Sticky-cached tag catalog with `forceRefresh`; static genre catalog.
  * lib/features/search/sources/mangabaka_source.dart (MangaBakaSource), lib/features/search/sources/search_sources.dart (searchSources): New source registered as its own group.
  * lib/features/search/filters/mangabaka_type_filter.dart (MangaBakaTypeFilter), mangabaka_genre_filter.dart (MangaBakaGenreFilter), mangabaka_tag_filter.dart (MangaBakaTagFilter), mangabaka_status_filter.dart (MangaBakaStatusFilter), mangabaka_content_rating_filter.dart (MangaBakaContentRatingFilter): New filters.

### Changed

- **Route every snackbar through the shared helper and shorten it**

  Eight notifications still used a bare `ScaffoldMessenger.showSnackBar` (plain,
  no icon, bottom-anchored) instead of `context.showSnack`. They now match every
  other toast: a floating snackbar with a type icon and colored border. The
  default visible duration also drops from 2 s to 750 ms so toasts feel snappier.

  * lib/shared/extensions/snackbar_extension.dart (SnackBarExtension.showSnack): Default `duration` 2 s → 750 ms.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_items_view.dart: Tag-update failure toast → `showSnack(..., SnackType.error)`.
  * lib/features/settings/content/browse_collections_content.dart: Online-collection import success / download failures → `showSnack` (success / error).
  * lib/features/settings/screens/gamepad_debug_screen.dart: Debug-log empty / export success / export failure → `showSnack` (info / success / error).

- **Unify every confirmation prompt on one shared dialog**

  Delete / clear / reset confirmations used to be hand-rolled one by one, so
  their wording and buttons drifted (some had a filled red button, some red
  text, some plain). They now all use a single `ConfirmDialog` styled like the
  tier-list delete prompt: two text buttons with the confirm action tinted red
  for destructive actions. Reversible actions (clear image cache, switch
  profile) keep a neutral confirm button.

  * lib/shared/widgets/confirm_dialog.dart (ConfirmDialog, ConfirmDialog.show): New shared confirm/cancel dialog returning `Future<bool>`; `destructive` tints the confirm button, `cancelLabel` defaults to the localized Cancel.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/create_collection_dialog.dart (DeleteCollectionDialog): Removed — its callers now use ConfirmDialog.
  * lib/features/collections/helpers/collection_actions.dart (CollectionActions.promptDeleteEmptyCollection, CollectionActions.removeItem, CollectionActions.deleteCollection), lib/features/collections/screens/home_screen.dart (_HomeScreenState._deleteCollection), lib/features/collections/screens/item_detail_screen.dart (_ItemDetailScreenState._removeFromCollection): Replace inline AlertDialogs with ConfirmDialog.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/bulk_action_bar.dart (BulkActionBar._handleRemove): Use ConfirmDialog; drop the now-unused `theme` argument.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/canvas_context_menu.dart (CanvasContextMenu._showDeleteConfirmation), lib/features/collections/widgets/tag_management_dialog.dart (_TagManagementDialogState._deleteTag), lib/features/collections/widgets/ra_achievements_section.dart (_RaAchievementsSectionState._unlinkRa): Use ConfirmDialog.
  * lib/features/settings/content/cache_content.dart (_clearCache, neutral confirm), lib/features/settings/content/database_content.dart (_resetDatabase), lib/features/settings/widgets/edit_profile_dialog.dart (_confirmDelete), lib/features/settings/screens/profiles_screen.dart (_switchProfile, neutral confirm): Use ConfirmDialog.
  * lib/features/tier_lists/screens/tier_lists_screen.dart (_handleDelete x2, _deleteGrid), lib/features/tier_lists/screens/tier_list_detail_screen.dart (_confirmClear), lib/features/tier_lists/screens/mood_grid_detail_screen.dart (_confirmResize, _confirmDelete): Use ConfirmDialog.
  * lib/features/wishlist/widgets/wishlist_dialogs.dart (WishlistDialogs): Drop the private `_confirm` helper; route confirmDeleteTag / confirmClearResolved / confirmDeleteItem / confirmBulkDelete through ConfirmDialog.

- **Unify segmented switchers on the shared pill style**

  The Material `SegmentedButton` controls in the add-image dialog, the
  edit-connection dialog and the SteamGridDB panel now use the app's rounded
  pill switcher, so every segmented control matches the item-detail status row.
  The pill gains an `expand` mode that splits the available width equally for
  narrow, full-width panels.

  * lib/shared/widgets/segmented_pill.dart (SegmentedPill.expand, SegmentedPillOption): Add an equal-width `expand` mode (Expanded segments, ellipsis labels, tighter padding).
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/dialogs/add_image_dialog.dart (_AddImageDialogState), lib/features/collections/widgets/dialogs/edit_connection_dialog.dart (_EditConnectionDialogState): Swap `SegmentedButton` for `SegmentedPill`.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/steamgriddb_panel.dart (_SteamGridDbPanelState._buildImageTypeSelector): Swap `SegmentedButton` for `SegmentedPill(expand: true)`.

- **Refine the item right-click / long-press context menu**

  Action entries (move, copy, remove, reorder) are now compact single-line rows
  instead of bulky list tiles. The status switcher became a full-width segmented
  pill under a "Status" header: the active status is tinted with its color while
  the rest stay muted, replacing the bordered icon grid.

  * lib/features/collections/widgets/context_menu_item.dart (contextMenuItem): New shared builder for dense icon-and-label menu entries.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/status_chip_row.dart (StatusChipRow, statusChipPopupMenuEntries): Redesign the status selector as a segmented pill and add a "Status" header.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_items_view.dart (CollectionItemsView), lib/features/home/screens/all_items_screen.dart (_AllItemsScreenState): Build action entries with contextMenuItem.

- **Disambiguate manga by provider across cache, collection, covers and mood grids**

  Manga from AniList and MangaBaka can share a numeric id, so manga identity is
  now the pair `(external_id, source)` instead of `external_id` alone. Existing
  manga stays AniList and is unaffected; refresh, export, import and full
  backups all carry the source. Manga cover images are namespaced per provider
  so two titles sharing an id can't overwrite each other's cover; old backups
  remap their manga covers on import so nothing re-downloads.

  * lib/core/database/schema.dart (DatabaseSchema.createMangaCacheTable, DatabaseSchema.createCollectionItemsTable, DatabaseSchema.createMoodGridCellsTable): `manga_cache` PK becomes composite `(id, source)`; `collection_items` and `mood_grid_cells` gain a `source` column; manga-only unique indexes include `COALESCE(source, 'anilist')`.
  * lib/core/database/migrations/migration_v44.dart (MigrationV44): Rebuilds `manga_cache` with the composite PK, backfills `source = 'anilist'`, re-scopes the non-game unique indexes.
  * lib/shared/models/manga.dart (Manga.source), lib/shared/models/collection_item.dart (CollectionItem.source, CollectionItem.coverImageId), lib/shared/models/mood_grid_cell.dart (MoodGridCell.source), lib/shared/models/cover_info.dart (CoverInfo.source, CoverInfo.coverImageId), lib/shared/models/canvas_item.dart (CanvasItem.mediaCacheId): Thread `source` through models and cover-cache ids.
  * lib/shared/utils/cover_image_id.dart (coverImageId): New canonical source-aware cover cache id (manga → `anilist_1995` / `mangabaka_1995`).
  * lib/core/database/dao/manga_dao.dart (MangaDao.getManga, MangaDao.getMangaByIds), lib/core/database/dao/collection_dao.dart (CollectionDao.addItemToCollection): Match manga on `(id, source)` in lookups, hydration and the cover join.
  * lib/core/services/export_service.dart (ExportService), lib/core/services/import_service.dart (ImportService): Carry `source` in exported records; remap legacy bare-id manga covers on import.
  * lib/features/collections/helpers/collection_actions.dart: Refresh routes manga to AniList or MangaBaka by `source`.
  * lib/shared/models/data_source.dart (DataSource.mangabaka, DataSource.fromName): New provider value and parser.

- **Rate by tapping a whole star, fine-tune with −/+ buttons**

  The personal-rating control no longer reads a fractional value from where you
  tap or drag. Tapping a star now sets a whole number 1–10, and two −/+ buttons
  next to the stars nudge the value by 0.1 to reach fractional ratings. The
  buttons are disabled until a rating is set. This applies everywhere the
  control appears — the item detail screen and the collection table popup.

  * lib/shared/widgets/fractional_star_rating.dart (FractionalStarRating): Tap
    snaps to a whole integer; drag removed; add −/+ nudge buttons (`step` 0.1,
    clamped 1.0–10.0, no-op at the bounds) and a private `_NudgeButton`;
    `naturalWidth` now accounts for the two buttons.

### Removed

- **Drop the "Copy as List" collection action**

  The collection menu had both "Copy as List" (a one-tap copy using the default
  `{name} ({year})` template) and "Copy as Text…" (the same template engine with
  a dialog, token picker, sort and preview). "Copy as List" was just the dialog's
  default with no options, so it is gone; "Copy as Text…" covers the same need
  and still opens on the default template.

  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_screen/collection_screen_fab.dart (CollectionMenuAction): Remove the `copyAsList` value and its menu item.
  * lib/features/collections/screens/collection_screen.dart (_CollectionScreenState): Remove the `copyAsList` switch case and `_handleCopyAsList`.
  * lib/features/collections/helpers/collection_actions.dart (CollectionActions.copyAsList): Removed, along with the now-unused `flutter/services.dart` and `text_export_service.dart` imports.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb (copyAsList): Removed string.

### Fixed

- **Stop imported titles showing as "Unknown" when AniList rate-limits a large import**

  Importing a big `.xcoll` (or AniList list) re-fetches each title's metadata
  from AniList in batches. A single rate-limit (429) part-way through made the
  whole anime / manga fetch throw and discard every result, so most titles
  ended up with no cached metadata and rendered as "Unknown anime" / "Unknown
  manga" (statuses and notes were intact — only the title/cover was missing).
  Batches now retry on 429 and keep partial results, so the cache fills in
  reliably.

  * lib/core/api/anilist/anilist_media_api.dart (AniListMediaApi.getAnimeByIds, AniListMediaApi.getMangaByIds): Per-batch retry on 429, tolerating a failed batch and keeping the partial result instead of throwing; added an `onRateLimit` callback.
  * lib/core/api/anilist_api.dart (AniListApi.getAnimeByIds, AniListApi.getMangaByIds): Forward `onRateLimit`.
  * lib/core/services/import_service.dart (ImportService): Surface rate-limit waits via import progress during the anime / manga re-fetch.

- **Stop large collections from crashing on Android (SQLite variable limit)**

  Opening a collection with more than ~999 items of one media type (e.g. a big
  MyAnimeList import) crashed on Android with "too many SQL variables" — the
  hydration `IN (...)` query exceeded the platform SQLite bound-parameter
  limit. Desktop was unaffected (its bundled SQLite allows 32766). Id-list
  queries are now chunked so any collection size works on every platform.

  * lib/core/database/query_chunk.dart (queryByIdsInChunks, kInClauseChunkSize): New chunked-IN helper (chunk size 900, under the 999 floor).
  * lib/core/database/dao/manga_dao.dart (MangaDao.getMangaByIds), anime_dao.dart (AnimeDao.getAnimeByIds), movie_dao.dart (MovieDao.getMoviesByTmdbIds), tv_show_dao.dart (TvShowDao.getTvShowsByTmdbIds), visual_novel_dao.dart (VisualNovelDao.getVisualNovelsByNumericIds), custom_media_dao.dart (CustomMediaDao.getByIds), game_dao.dart (GameDao.getGamesByIds, GameDao.getPlatformsByIds), tracker_dao.dart (TrackerDao.getGameDataForGameIds): Run the `IN (...)` lookup through `queryByIdsInChunks`.

- **Stop the gamepad plugin from crashing the app on Windows**

  Some Windows users hit a hard crash (access violation `0xc0000005` in
  `gamepads_windows_plugin.dll`) because the app started polling input devices
  at launch for everyone, and the native plugin faults during device polling
  on certain machines. Gamepad support is now disabled on Windows; Linux,
  macOS, and Android are unaffected. The `gamepads` plugins were also bumped to
  their latest patches.

  * lib/shared/constants/platform_features.dart (kGamepadSupported): Exclude
    Windows in addition to iOS.
  * lib/shared/gamepad/widgets/gamepad_listener.dart (GamepadListener): Drop the
    duplicate platform gate — the event stream is silent when the service is not
    started, so the subscription is safe on every platform.
  * lib/shared/gamepad/gamepad_provider.dart (gamepadServiceProvider): Update the
    doc comment for the Windows case.
  * pubspec.lock: Bump `gamepads` 0.1.10+1 → 0.1.10+2, `gamepads_windows`
    0.3.0 → 0.3.0+1, `gamepads_web` 0.1.1 → 0.1.1+1.

## [0.31.0] - 2026-05-29

### Added

- **Configurable row captions on mood grids**

  Each mood grid can render a text column to the right of every row, with one
  line per cell. Content is driven by a per-grid template — supported tokens
  are `{{name}}`, `{{year}}`, `{{genre}}`, `{{rating}}` — so the user can
  decide whether captions show "Elden Ring" or "Elden Ring (2022) — 9.4".
  The template is edited from a dialog under the floating-action button,
  with chips that insert tokens at the cursor. Captions appear in both the
  editor and the PNG export. By default the template is empty and no column
  is rendered, so existing grids look unchanged until the user opts in.

  * lib/core/database/schema.dart (DatabaseSchema.createMoodGridsTable):
    Add `caption_template TEXT` column.
  * lib/core/database/migrations/migration_v43.dart (MigrationV43): New —
    `ALTER TABLE mood_grids ADD COLUMN caption_template TEXT`.
  * lib/core/database/migrations/migration_registry.dart
    (MigrationRegistry.all): Register `MigrationV43`.
  * lib/core/database/database_service.dart: Bump database version to 43.
  * lib/shared/models/mood_grid.dart (MoodGrid.captionTemplate,
    MoodGrid.fromDb, MoodGrid.toDb, MoodGrid.fromExport, MoodGrid.toExport,
    MoodGrid.copyWith, MoodGrid.copyWith.clearCaptionTemplate): New nullable
    field plumbed through serialisation and `copyWith` (with an explicit
    `clearCaptionTemplate` flag).
  * lib/core/database/dao/mood_grid_dao.dart
    (MoodGridDao.setCaptionTemplate): New — persists the template, normalises
    empty strings to NULL, bumps `updated_at`.
  * lib/features/tier_lists/services/mood_grid_caption.dart
    (renderRowCaption, kMoodGridCaptionTokens): New — token substitution
    engine and the public token list used by the editor dialog.
  * lib/features/tier_lists/widgets/mood_grid_cell_media.dart
    (MoodGridCellMedia.year, MoodGridCellMedia.genre,
    MoodGridCellMedia.rating, MoodGridCellMedia.empty,
    resolveMoodGridCellMedia): Extend cell payload with year / genre /
    rating per media type; IGDB game rating and AniList scores normalised
    to a 0–10 scale; static `empty` sentinel for null-free indexing.
  * lib/features/tier_lists/widgets/mood_grid_cell_widget.dart
    (MoodGridCellWidget, MoodGridCellWidget.media): Drop the per-cell
    `FutureBuilder` and the `ConsumerWidget` dependency; the parent passes
    resolved media directly.
  * lib/features/tier_lists/providers/mood_grid_detail_provider.dart
    (MoodGridDetailState.mediaByPosition,
    MoodGridDetailNotifier.setCaptionTemplate,
    MoodGridDetailNotifier._resolveAll,
    MoodGridDetailNotifier._resolveOne,
    MoodGridDetailNotifier._replaceCellAndMedia): Preload media for every
    cell in parallel via `Future.wait`, re-resolve only the touched cell on
    item change, expose `setCaptionTemplate`.
  * lib/features/tier_lists/widgets/mood_grid_row_captions.dart
    (MoodGridRowCaptions): New widget — tight-packed list of caption lines
    rendered through the template.
  * lib/features/tier_lists/widgets/mood_grid_view.dart (MoodGridView,
    MoodGridView.mediaByPosition, MoodGridView.captionWidth): Append the
    caption column to each row when a template is set.
  * lib/features/tier_lists/widgets/mood_grid_export_view.dart
    (MoodGridExportView, MoodGridExportView.mediaByPosition): Same caption
    column in the offscreen PNG render.
  * lib/features/tier_lists/screens/mood_grid_detail_screen.dart
    (_MoodGridDetailScreenState._editCaptionTemplate,
    _CaptionTemplateDialog): New FAB entry and dialog with a multi-line
    `TextField`, token chips that insert at the cursor, plus Save / Clear /
    Cancel actions.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb,
    lib/l10n/app_localizations.dart, lib/l10n/app_localizations_en.dart,
    lib/l10n/app_localizations_ru.dart (moodGridCaptionTemplate,
    moodGridCaptionTemplateHint, moodGridCaptionTemplateClear): New
    strings for the editor dialog.
  * test/features/tier_lists/services/mood_grid_caption_test.dart
    (renderRowCaption, kMoodGridCaptionTokens): New — token substitution
    happy path, missing fields, rating decimal formatting, empty template,
    empty media, token list snapshot.
  * test/shared/models/mood_grid_test.dart (MoodGrid.captionTemplate,
    MoodGrid.copyWith.clearCaptionTemplate): captionTemplate round-trips
    through `toDb`/`fromDb` and `toExport`/`fromExport`; `copyWith` sets
    and clears it.

- **Export selected items as a poster mosaic PNG from the bulk action bar**

  Selecting items in a collection or on All Items reveals a new image
  button in the bulk action bar. It opens a dialog with a preview, an
  auto-picked column count and a slider to override, then saves the
  full selection as a dense poster grid PNG via FilePicker on desktop
  or the system gallery on Android (album "Tonkatsu Box"). The
  watermark row at the bottom matches the tier-list export so every
  PNG out of the app carries the same signature.

  * lib/features/collections/widgets/bulk_export/bulk_poster_mosaic_view.dart
    (BulkPosterMosaicView, BulkPosterMosaicView.autoColumns,
    BulkPosterMosaicView.precachedFiles, _PosterTile): New off-screen
    `RepaintBoundary` widget; `autoColumns` returns
    `sqrt(n * 1.5).round().clamp(4, 20)`.
  * lib/shared/services/png_export_service.dart (saveBoundaryAsPng,
    BulkExportResult, BulkExportStatus, sanitizeFileName,
    ensurePngExtension, stripPngExtension): New shared service —
    boundary to PNG bytes plus desktop FilePicker save and Android
    `Gal.putImageBytes` (avoids a `name.png.jpg` quirk seen with
    `Gal.putImage` on some devices). `sanitizeFileName` keeps Unicode
    letters and digits so Cyrillic / CJK names survive.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/bulk_export/bulk_poster_export_dialog.dart
    (showBulkPosterExportDialog, _BulkPosterExportDialog,
    _BulkPosterExportDialogState._handleSave,
    _BulkPosterExportDialogState._precacheCovers,
    _BulkPosterExportDialogState._precacheOne): New — preview capped
    at 120 covers, column slider, batched cover precache with
    progress before the off-screen mosaic is snapshot.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/bulk_action_bar.dart (BulkActionBar,
    BulkActionBar.collectionName, BulkActionBar._handleExportPng):
    New image button next to the status menu; forwards
    `collectionName` so the saved file is named after the collection.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_screen/collection_bulk_action_bar.dart
    (CollectionBulkActionBar, CollectionBulkActionBar.collectionName):
    Threads the collection name through.
  * lib/features/collections/screens/collection_screen.dart
    (_CollectionScreenState.build): Passes `_collection?.name` (or the
    uncategorised label) to the bulk bar.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb, lib/l10n/app_localizations.dart,
    lib/l10n/app_localizations_en.dart, lib/l10n/app_localizations_ru.dart
    (bulkExportPngTitle, bulkExportPngColumns, bulkExportPngItemsCount,
    bulkExportPngItemsCountPreview, bulkExportPngPreparing,
    bulkExportPngSave, bulkExportPngSaved, bulkExportPngFailed): New
    strings for the dialog, the truncated-preview hint, and snackbars.
  * test/features/collections/widgets/bulk_export/bulk_poster_mosaic_view_test.dart:
    New — `autoColumns` formula at the empty / tiny / typical / huge
    boundaries, plus renders-without-exception on 8 and 50 items.
  * test/shared/services/png_export_service_test.dart (sanitizeFileName,
    ensurePngExtension, stripPngExtension): New — sanitiser keeps
    Cyrillic / CJK letters; round-trip cases for the two PNG extension
    helpers.

- **Add AniList tag support across storage, display, search filter and exports**

  Anime and manga now carry their AniList tag list (in addition to genres).
  Tags are pulled from the API into a new `tags` cache column, shown as a
  secondary chip row in the search-result details sheet and as a
  comma-separated chip on the collection item detail screen, and exported
  via a new `{tags}` token in the text-export template plus the `.xcoll` /
  `.xcollx` payload. Refresh-from-source backfills tags for items that were
  added before this change. Search gains an "AniList tag" multi-select
  filter on the Anime and Manga tabs, served by a SQLite-cached catalog
  (~600 tags) refreshed weekly. The filter opens a dedicated bottom-sheet
  picker with live name search, category-grouped collapsible sections,
  toggles for spoiler and 18+ tags, a manual refresh button, and a
  selected-count footer with Clear all / Cancel / Apply.

  * lib/shared/models/anilist_tag.dart (AniListTag, AniListTag.fromJson,
    AniListTag.fromDb, AniListTag.toDb): New model with id, name,
    category, description, isAdult, isGeneralSpoiler.
  * lib/shared/models/anime.dart (Anime.tags, Anime.tagsString,
    Anime.fromJson, Anime.fromDb, Anime.toDb, Anime.copyWith),
    lib/shared/models/manga.dart (Manga.tags, Manga.tagsString,
    Manga.fromJson, Manga.fromDb, Manga.toDb, Manga.copyWith): Add a
    nullable `List<String>` tags field; parse `tags { name }` from
    GraphQL; JSON-encode in the new SQLite column.
  * lib/core/database/schema.dart (DatabaseSchema.createAniListTagsTable,
    DatabaseSchema.createMangaCacheTable,
    DatabaseSchema.createAnimeCacheTable, DatabaseSchema.createAll):
    Declare the catalog table and the new `tags` column for fresh
    installs; register the catalog table in `createAll`.
  * lib/core/database/migrations/migration_v41.dart (MigrationV41): New —
    `ALTER TABLE anime_cache / manga_cache ADD COLUMN tags TEXT`.
  * lib/core/database/migrations/migration_v42.dart (MigrationV42): New —
    creates the `anilist_tags` catalog table via
    `DatabaseSchema.createAniListTagsTable`.
  * lib/core/database/migrations/migration_registry.dart
    (MigrationRegistry.all): Register MigrationV41 and MigrationV42.
  * lib/core/database/database_service.dart (DatabaseService.aniListTagDao,
    aniListTagDaoProvider, OpenDatabaseOptions.version): Expose the new
    DAO and bump the schema version to 42.
  * lib/core/database/dao/anilist_tag_dao.dart (AniListTagDao,
    AniListTagDao.getAll, AniListTagDao.lastUpdatedAt,
    AniListTagDao.replaceAll): New DAO; `replaceAll` is transactional
    truncate + batch insert so a partial refresh can't leave a
    half-updated catalog.
  * lib/data/repositories/anilist_tags_repository.dart
    (AniListTagsRepository, AniListTagsRepository.getTags,
    aniListTagsRepositoryProvider, aniListTagsProvider): New cache
    layer. A non-empty cache is sticky — refresh only happens via the
    picker's Refresh button (forceRefresh) or when the cache is empty.
    On API failure, falls back to the cached set; on empty cache,
    rethrows.
  * lib/core/api/anilist/anilist_queries.dart
    (AniListQueries.tagCollection, AniListQueries.mangaSearch,
    AniListQueries.animeSearch, AniListQueries.mangaGetById,
    AniListQueries.mangaGetByIds, AniListQueries.animeGetById,
    AniListQueries.animeGetByIds, AniListQueries.animeGetByMalIds,
    AniListQueries.mangaGetByMalIds, AniListQueries.userAnimeList,
    AniListQueries.userMangaList): Add `tags { name }` to every media
    query; add `$tags: [String]` + `tag_in: $tags` on search queries;
    add the standalone `MediaTagCollection` query.
  * lib/core/api/anilist/anilist_media_api.dart
    (AniListMediaApi.browseAnime, AniListMediaApi.browseManga,
    AniListMediaApi.fetchTagCollection),
    lib/core/api/anilist_api.dart (AniListApi.browseAnime,
    AniListApi.browseManga, AniListApi.fetchTagCollection): Accept
    `List<String>? tags`; new top-level `fetchTagCollection` method.
  * lib/features/search/models/search_source.dart
    (SearchFilter.openCustomPicker): New optional hook — when present,
    the filter chevron opens this picker instead of the default
    dropdown / SearchableFilterDialog.
  * lib/features/search/widgets/filter_bar.dart
    (_FilterDropdownChevronState.build),
    lib/features/search/widgets/filter_sheet.dart
    (_FilterRowState._openDialog, _FilterRowState.build, _SortTile.build):
    Honour the custom picker hook (both the chevron bar and the
    narrow-screen sheet). Filter / sort rows now wrap their ListTile in
    a transparent Material so ink ripples render over the sheet's
    DecoratedBox surface.
  * lib/features/search/filters/anilist_tag_filter.dart
    (AniListTagFilter, AniListTagFilter.options,
    AniListTagFilter.openCustomPicker): New SearchFilter; loads options
    lazily via aniListTagsProvider and points the filter bar at the
    custom picker.
  * lib/features/search/widgets/anilist_tag_picker.dart
    (showAniListTagPicker, _AniListTagPicker,
    _AniListTagPickerState._refresh, _AniListTagPickerState._buildList,
    _AniListTagPickerState._groupAndFilter): New bottom-sheet picker
    with grouped collapsible categories, live search, spoiler / adult
    toggles, manual refresh, and Apply / Cancel.

  * lib/features/search/widgets/item_details_sheet.dart
    (ItemDetailsSheet, ItemDetailsSheet.anime, ItemDetailsSheet.manga,

  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb (browseFilterTag,
    tagPickerTitle, tagPickerSearchHint, tagPickerShowSpoilers,

    tagsString getter.
  * test/core/services/text_export_service_test.dart: New cases for the

- **Add anime & manga title-language setting with override-aware rename**

  Settings → Appearance gains a new "Anime & manga title language"
  option with three variants — Romaji / English / Native. The choice
  drives the title shown for anime and manga across the whole app:
  collection lists, table, item detail, All items home tab, tier
  lists, mood-grid picker, snackbars, exports, Discord RPC, and the
  search results grid / details sheet. Per-item rename override (set
  via the rename dialog) always wins regardless of the setting. The
  rename dialog for anime/manga also surfaces Romaji / English /
  Native chips so users can pick a variant without typing. Storage is
  unchanged — both manual override (`override_name` column) and the
  three AniList title columns (`title`, `title_english`,
  `title_native`) already exist; the setting is a pure display layer
  and is included in the config export / import.

  * lib/shared/utils/anime_manga_title_language.dart
    (AnimeMangaTitleLanguage, AnimeMangaTitleLanguage.fromId,
    pickAnimeMangaTitle): New enum + pure picker with fallback chain
    (romaji is the universal fallback because AniList always returns
    it).
  * lib/shared/models/anime.dart (Anime.titleByLanguage),
    lib/shared/models/manga.dart (Manga.titleByLanguage): Return the
    requested variant with a fallback to romaji.
  * lib/shared/models/collection_item.dart (CollectionItem.displayName):
    Override wins; for anime / manga delegates to `titleByLanguage`;
    for other media types returns `itemName`.
  * lib/features/collections/extensions/item_display_name.dart
    (CollectionItemDisplay on WidgetRef, displayNameOf,
    currentDisplayNameOf): New extension — `watch`-based getter for
    `build` and `read`-based snapshot for async handlers. Replaces an
    earlier provider-family approach that cached stale values after
    rename because `CollectionItem.==` is id-only.
  * lib/features/settings/providers/settings_provider.dart
    (SettingsKeys.animeMangaTitleLanguage,
    SettingsKeys.animeMangaTitleLanguageDefault,
    SettingsState.animeMangaTitleLanguage,
    SettingsNotifier.setAnimeMangaTitleLanguage,
    SettingsNotifier._loadFromPrefs, SettingsNotifier.clearSettings,
    AnimeMangaTitleLanguagePrefs on SharedPreferences): Persist and
    expose the chosen language id. The `SharedPreferences` extension
    is for non-UI code (services, sort, filter) that mustn't depend
    on Riverpod notifiers.
  * lib/features/settings/screens/settings_screen.dart
    (_SettingsScreenState._showAnimeMangaTitleLanguagePicker): New
    tile under Appearance with three radio options.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/rename_item_dialog.dart
    (RenameSuggestion, RenameItemDialog): Accept an optional list of
    suggestions rendered as `ActionChip`s that prefill the text field.
  * lib/features/collections/screens/item_detail_screen.dart
    (_ItemDetailScreenState._renameItem,
    _ItemDetailScreenState._addAnimeMangaSuggestions): Build Romaji /
    English / Native suggestions for anime/manga before showing the
    rename dialog.
  * lib/features/search/widgets/item_details_sheet.dart
    (ItemDetailsSheet.anime, ItemDetailsSheet.manga): New
    `anilistTitleLanguage` parameter; main title uses the setting,
    subtitle shows romaji when the displayed title is not romaji
    (canonical reference).
  * lib/features/search/handlers/media_handlers.dart
    (MediaHandlerRegistry): Read the current language from
    `settingsNotifierProvider` for `titleOf` and `sheetBuilder`
    closures.
  * lib/features/search/widgets/browse_grid.dart
    (_BrowseGridState.build, _BrowseGridState._buildCard,
    _BrowseGridState._extractTitle): Watch the language at build
    scope; thread it into anime/manga cards and the client-side title
    filter.
  * lib/core/services/config_service.dart (ConfigService._settingsKeys):
    Include `animeMangaTitleLanguage` in the exported settings keys.
  * lib/features/collections/helpers/collection_actions.dart,
    collection_filters.dart, providers/sort_utils.dart,
    providers/collections_provider.dart,
    screens/collection_screen.dart,
    widgets/collection_item_tile.dart, collection_items_view.dart,
    collection_screen/collection_bulk_action_bar.dart,

    tier_item_card.dart, tier_list_view.dart,
    lib/core/services/discord_rpc_service.dart,
    text_export_service.dart: Switch from `item.itemName` /
    `ref.watch(itemDisplayNameProvider(item))` to either
    `ref.displayNameOf(item)` (UI) or `item.displayName(lang)`
    (services, sort, filter, exports), threading the language value
    from `settingsNotifierProvider` / `sharedPreferencesProvider`.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, app_ru.arb (settingsAnimeMangaTitleLanguage,
    settingsAnimeMangaTitleLanguageSubtitle,
    settingsAnimeMangaTitleLanguageRomaji,
    settingsAnimeMangaTitleLanguageEnglish,
    settingsAnimeMangaTitleLanguageNative): New strings for the
    setting tile and language picker. Romaji / English / Native are
    kept latin in both locales — they're system names.

- **Add a date format setting for the whole app**

  Settings → Appearance now has a Date format option with four presets:
  ISO (2026-05-25), DMY with dots (25.05.2026), MDY with slashes
  (05/25/2026) and DMY with the localised month name (25 May 2026).
  The choice is applied wherever the app renders a `DateTime` to the
  user: collection card Activity Dates, episode tracker watched-date,
  and RetroAchievements unlock dates. Storage is unchanged — the
  setting only affects presentation. The preset id is persisted in
  `SharedPreferences` and is included in the config export / import.

  * lib/shared/utils/date_format_preset.dart (DateFormatPreset,
    DateFormatPreset.fromId, DateFormatPreset.format): New enum of
    presets backed by `intl.DateFormat` patterns.
  * lib/features/settings/providers/settings_provider.dart
    (SettingsKeys.dateFormat, SettingsKeys.dateFormatDefault,
    SettingsState.dateFormat, SettingsNotifier.setDateFormat,
    SettingsNotifier._loadFromPrefs, SettingsNotifier.clearSettings):
    Persist and expose the chosen preset id.
  * lib/features/settings/screens/settings_screen.dart
    (_SettingsScreenState._dateFormatLabel,
    _SettingsScreenState._showDateFormatPicker): New tile and picker
    dialog under Appearance.
  * lib/core/services/config_service.dart (ConfigService._settingsKeys):
    Add `SettingsKeys.dateFormat` to the exported keys.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/activity_dates_section.dart
    (ActivityDatesSection, _DateRow): Switch from a hardcoded
    `_formatDate` to the preset chosen in settings; widget becomes
    `ConsumerWidget`.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/episode_tracker_section.dart:
    Drop the hardcoded month array; format the watched-date through
    the preset.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/ra_achievements_section.dart
    (_RaAchievementsSectionState._formatDate): Keep the relative
    today / yesterday / N days ago labels; format the older fallback
    through the preset.
  * lib/shared/widgets/media_detail_view.dart (MediaDetailView,
    _MediaDetailViewState, _MediaDetailViewState._buildActivityDatesRow,
    _MediaDetailViewState._buildDateChip, _formatActivityDate): Switch
    to `ConsumerStatefulWidget`; chip formatter takes a `formatter`
    closure so the preset is resolved once per row build.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb: Add
    `settingsDateFormat`, `settingsDateFormatSubtitle`.

- **Custom date picker dialog with calendar and text input side by side**

  Replaces Material `showDatePicker` for the Activity Dates picker:
  shows a `CalendarDatePicker` and a `TextField` (yyyy-MM-dd) at the
  same time, kept in sync. Tap a day on the calendar to fill the
  field; type a valid date in the field to move the calendar. The OK
  button is disabled while the typed value is empty, malformed, or out
  of range. Desktop lays them out in a row, Android stacks them with
  the text field on top so it stays visible above the keyboard.

  * lib/shared/widgets/dual_date_picker_dialog.dart
    (DualDatePickerDialog, _DualDatePickerDialogState, showDualDatePicker):
    New.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/activity_dates_section.dart
    (ActivityDatesSection._pickDate),
    lib/shared/widgets/media_detail_view.dart
    (_MediaDetailViewState._pickActivityDate): Call `showDualDatePicker`
    instead of `showDatePicker`.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb: Add
    `dualDatePickerInputLabel`, `dualDatePickerOk`, `dualDatePickerCancel`,
    `dualDatePickerErrorEmpty`, `dualDatePickerErrorFormat`,
    `dualDatePickerErrorRange`.

### Changed

- **Unify mobile image save to a folder picker across all PNG exports**

  Bulk poster export and tier-list export on Android used to drop the PNG
  straight into a fixed "Tonkatsu Box" gallery album with no say over the
  destination. They now open the system folder picker (Storage Access
  Framework), matching how mood-grid export already behaved. The shared
  `saveBoundaryAsPng` service is the single save path for all three, and
  mood-grid export was refactored onto it instead of carrying its own copy.
  The `gal` dependency and the gallery permissions it required are gone.

  * lib/shared/services/png_export_service.dart (saveBoundaryAsPng): Replace
    the Android `Gal.putImageBytes` branch with `FilePicker.saveFile` using
    `FileType.any` plus `bytes` so file_picker writes via SAF; desktop path
    unchanged.
  * lib/features/tier_lists/screens/mood_grid_detail_screen.dart
    (_MoodGridDetailScreenState._exportAsImage): Refactor onto the shared
    `saveBoundaryAsPng`; drop the inline FilePicker / RenderRepaintBoundary
    duplication and the now-unused dart:io, dart:ui, file_picker and
    flutter/services imports.
  * pubspec.yaml: Remove the `gal` dependency, used only by the old save path.
  * android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml: Remove `WRITE_EXTERNAL_STORAGE`
    and `READ_MEDIA_IMAGES`, declared only for `gal` — SAF requires neither.

- **Tier-list detail page is faster on large collections and easier to use on mobile**

  Several wins land together. Derived collections on `TierListDetailState`
  (`entriesByTier`, `itemsById`, `unrankedItems`, `placedItemIds`) are
  precomputed in a factory instead of recomputed as getters on every
  build. `TierItemCard` is a plain `StatelessWidget` taking a resolved
  `displayName`, so each card no longer subscribes to the settings
  provider. The Unranked pool switched from a non-lazy `Wrap` to a
  `GridView.builder`, virtualising hundreds of cards. The divider
  between tiers and the Unranked pool became a vertical drag handle so
  the user can redistribute space between the two regions. On mobile,
  cards use `LongPressDraggable` instead of `Draggable` so finger
  swipes scroll instead of accidentally picking up a card; `Tooltip`
  switches to `manual` trigger when draggable on mobile to avoid
  stealing the long-press gesture. Tier-list PNG export now reuses the
  shared `saveBoundaryAsPng` service (same code path as bulk poster
  export), with `ensurePngExtension` handling the case where the user
  wipes the `.png` in the save dialog.

  * lib/features/tier_lists/providers/tier_list_detail_provider.dart
    (TierListDetailState, TierListDetailState._, TierListDetailState.loading,
    TierListDetailState.itemsById, TierListDetailState.placedItemIds,
    TierListDetailState.entriesByTier, TierListDetailState.unrankedItems,
    TierListDetailNotifier.moveBetweenTiers): Factory precomputes derived
    collections once; `moveBetweenTiers` collapses to a single
    `setItemTier` call (one DB write, one state update).
  * lib/features/tier_lists/widgets/tier_item_card.dart (TierItemCard,
    TierItemCard.displayName, TierItemCard.labelHeight,
    TierItemCard._buildCard): `StatelessWidget`; `displayName` is a
    required parameter; `labelHeight` parameter lets parents reserve
    exactly the height they pass to GridView `mainAxisExtent`; label
    text capped at 2 lines with ellipsis; `LongPressDraggable` on
    mobile, plain `Draggable` on desktop; Tooltip uses
    `TooltipTriggerMode.manual` when draggable on mobile.
  * lib/features/tier_lists/widgets/tier_list_view.dart (TierListView,
    _TierListViewState, _TierListViewState._topHeight,
    _TierListViewState._handleDragUpdate, _UnrankedPool, _SplitterHandle):
    `ConsumerStatefulWidget` hosting the splitter height; LayoutBuilder
    splits the screen into tier list (top) and Unranked grid (bottom);
    `_UnrankedPool` renders cards with `GridView.builder` and
    `SliverGridDelegateWithMaxCrossAxisExtent`; `_SplitterHandle` is a
    new private widget driving the drag gesture.
  * lib/features/tier_lists/widgets/tier_row.dart (TierRowMetrics.compact,
    TierRow.titleLanguage): compact `cardLabelMinHeight` bumped from 24
    to 28 to fit two lines of 10pt text; `titleLanguage` is passed in
    and forwarded to each card so cards remain stateless.
  * lib/features/tier_lists/widgets/tier_list_export_view.dart
    (TierListExportView.titleLanguage): same `titleLanguage` plumbing
    for the offscreen export render.
  * lib/features/tier_lists/screens/tier_list_detail_screen.dart
    (_TierListDetailScreenState._exportAsImage): reuses
    `saveBoundaryAsPng` with `BulkExportResult` → snackbar mapping.
  * test/features/tier_lists/providers/tier_list_detail_provider_test.dart,
    test/features/tier_lists/widgets/tier_item_card_test.dart,
    test/features/tier_lists/widgets/tier_list_export_view_test.dart,
    test/features/tier_lists/widgets/tier_row_test.dart: Updated for
    the new `displayName` / `titleLanguage` / `labelHeight` parameters
    and the collapsed `moveBetweenTiers` call sequence.

- **Make the personal rating fractional (1.0–10.0, step 0.1)**

  Personal rating moves from a whole number to a one-decimal value. The
  rating widget keeps its inline tap flow but gains a leading dash cell that
  clears the rating to null and fills stars partially for fractional values;
  the table cell editor reuses the same widget. Badges and the detail screen
  now render one decimal (`8.5`). AniList import keeps full precision
  (a 0–100 score maps `85 → 8.5` instead of `8`). The `.xcoll` / `.xcollx`
  format version bumps to 3; older builds cleanly refuse v3 files, while the
  current build still reads v2 files (legacy integer ratings load as
  doubles). The database column stays `INTEGER` and relies on SQLite type
  affinity to store the fractional value, so no migration is needed.

  * lib/shared/models/collection_item.dart (CollectionItem.userRating):
    `int? → double?`; read via `(… as num?)?.toDouble()` in
    `fromDbWithJoins` and `fromExport` for legacy-int back-compat.
  * lib/shared/widgets/fractional_star_rating.dart (FractionalStarRating):
    New tap/drag rating widget with a leading clear cell and partial fill;
    replaces the removed `StarRatingBar`.
  * lib/shared/widgets/star_rating_bar.dart: Removed.
  * lib/shared/widgets/media_detail_view.dart (MediaDetailView.userRating,
    MediaDetailView.onUserRatingChanged): `int? → double?`; use
    `FractionalStarRating`; format value via `toStringAsFixed(1)`.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_table/cells/rating_cell.dart
    (RatingCell): `double?` rating; popup hosts `FractionalStarRating`.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_table/collection_table_view.dart
    (_CollectionTableViewState._filterRating, onRatingChanged),
    table_row.dart (TableRow.onRatingChanged), table_header.dart
    (TableHeader.filterRating): `int? → double?`.
  * lib/shared/widgets/dual_rating_badge.dart (DualRatingBadge.userRating,
    DualRatingBadge.formattedRating), media_poster_card.dart
    (MediaPosterCard.userRating): `int? → double?`; one-decimal formatting.
  * lib/core/database/dao/collection_dao.dart
    (CollectionDao.updateItemUserRating), database_service.dart
    (DatabaseService.updateItemUserRating), collection_repository.dart
    (CollectionRepository.updateItemUserRating),
    collections_provider.dart (CollectionItemsNotifier.updateUserRating):
    `int? → double?`; range assert `1.0–10.0`.
  * lib/core/database/schema.dart: Note `user_rating` keeps INTEGER affinity
    while storing fractional values.
  * lib/core/services/anilist_import_service.dart
    (AniListImportService._resolveRating): Return `double?`, map POINT_100
    via `/ 10.0`.
  * lib/core/services/mal_import_service.dart (MalEntry.score),
    trakt_zip_import_service.dart, kodi_sync_service.dart,
    kodi_movie.dart (KodiMovie.userRating), kodi_tv_show.dart
    (KodiTvShow.userRating): Carry the rating as `double`.
  * lib/core/services/xcoll_file.dart (xcollFormatVersion,
    xcollMinReadableVersion, XcollFile._parseV2): Bump format to 3, read v2
    and v3.
  * lib/core/services/text_export_service.dart (TextExportService.formatItem):
    `{myRating}` token uses `toStringAsFixed(1)`.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb, app_localizations*.dart
    (detailRatingValue): Placeholder type `int → String`.

- **Unify card ratings across collection and home screens; drop list view**

  Collection and All Items grids now split the two ratings: the personal
  rating stays in the top-left badge (just the value, no slash) and the
  external rating moves down to the subtitle row next to the year, so the
  poster is no longer dominated by a stacked "user / api" pair. The
  collection table gains a dedicated "External" column (sortable, 60px,
  centered) so the API rating is visible in table view too. Search keeps
  the combined badge — it has no personal rating to split out. The list view
  (and its drag-to-reorder variant) is removed: drag-to-reorder now lives
  in the table, the grid covers the visual browse use case, and the tile
  duplicated the poster card without adding anything the user couldn't get
  from a row of cards.

  * lib/shared/widgets/media_poster_card.dart (MediaPosterCard.splitRatings,
    MediaPosterCard._buildSubtitle): New `splitRatings` flag; when true the
    badge holds only the personal rating and the API rating leads the
    subtitle row.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_items_view.dart
    (CollectionItemsView, CollectionItemsView._buildGridCard,
    CollectionItemsView._withHeader): Drop `isGridMode`, remove the list and
    reorderable-list paths and their helpers; pass `splitRatings: true` to
    the grid card.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_item_tile.dart
    (CollectionItemTile): Removed.
  * lib/features/collections/screens/collection_screen.dart
    (_CollectionScreenState.build): Stop forwarding `isGridMode` to
    `CollectionItemsView` (the view derives grid mode from `!isTableMode`).
  * lib/features/home/screens/all_items_screen.dart
    (_AllItemsScreenState._buildGrid): Pass `splitRatings: true`.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/recommendations_section.dart
    (_RecommendationRowState.build): Pass `splitRatings: true`.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_table/table_column.dart
    (TableColumn.externalRating): New enum value.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_table/table_header.dart
    (TableHeader._col): Render the "External" column header.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_table/table_row.dart
    (_RowContent.build): Render the API rating cell.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_table/collection_table_view.dart
    (_CollectionTableViewState._sort): Sort case for `externalRating` by
    `CollectionItem.apiRating`.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb, lib/l10n/app_localizations.dart,
    lib/l10n/app_localizations_en.dart, lib/l10n/app_localizations_ru.dart
    (collectionTableExternalRating): New string ("External" / "Внешний").
  * test/features/collections/widgets/collection_item_tile_test.dart:
    Removed.
  * test/features/collections/widgets/collection_items_view_test.dart:
    Drop list / reorderable groups; tighten remaining grid + context-menu
    cases.
  * test/features/collections/widgets/collection_table_view_test.dart
    (group 'TableColumn'): Expect 9 columns including `externalRating`.
  * test/features/collections/widgets/recommendations_section_test.dart:
    Year assertion uses `textContaining` because the rating now shares the
    subtitle line.

### Fixed

- **Fix custom items: cannot change media-type while editing, covers missing from collection preview**

  Two long-standing bugs in the custom-items feature. The edit dialog
  hid the media-type chip row when opened on an existing item, so
  there was no way to change the displayed type once an item had been
  created. The collection-preview mosaic on Home (the 5-cover grid)
  always skipped custom items because the underlying SQL had no
  branch joining `custom_items` — every custom item rendered as
  "no cover available" even when a cover URL or local file was set.

  * lib/features/collections/widgets/create_custom_item_dialog.dart
    (_CreateCustomItemDialogState._selectedType,
    _CreateCustomItemDialogState.initState,
    _CreateCustomItemDialogState.build): Drop the `!_isEditing` guard
    around the chip row; initialise `_selectedType` from
    `existing.displayType` (falls back to `MediaType.custom`).
  * lib/features/collections/screens/item_detail_screen.dart
    (_ItemDetailScreenState._editCustomItem): Thread the picked
    `mediaType` into `CustomMedia.copyWith` via
    `displayType` + `clearDisplayType` so switching back to plain
    "Custom" actually clears the persisted display type.
  * lib/core/database/dao/collection_dao.dart
    (CollectionDao.getCollectionCovers): Add a `WHEN 'custom' THEN
    cm.cover_url` branch and a `LEFT JOIN custom_items cm` so custom
    rows show up in the preview alongside other media types. Handles
    both real URLs and the `local://cover` marker for file-uploaded
    art (the renderer already resolves the marker through the local
    image cache).
  * test/features/collections/widgets/create_custom_item_dialog_test.dart:
    New — chip row renders in edit mode, preselects the matching
    chip, defaults to Custom when displayType is null, and Save
    returns the picked `mediaType`.
  * test/core/database/dao/collection_dao_covers_test.dart: New —
    custom items with cover_url are returned, the `local://cover`
    marker passes through as-is, null cover_url is skipped, custom
    and other media types coexist within the limit.

- **Drop styling-only widget tests**

  Tests that asserted on colours, exact widget types used purely for
  styling, badge dimensions, fixed `SizedBox` widths, font weights of
  decorative text, and similar visual concerns were removed across
  the test suite — design changes shouldn't break the test gate.
  Behaviour assertions (callback fires, conditional widget appears,
  parser outputs the right span type) are kept.

  * test/features/settings/widgets/status_dot_test.dart: Remove the
    "badge decoration", "compact mode", "text color matches status"
    and "Row layout" groups; keep symbol-mapping tests (which verify
    StatusType → symbol logic).
  * test/features/welcome/widgets/welcome_step_ready_test.dart:
    Collapse to three tests — renders without exception, fires
    onGoToSettings, fires onSkip. Drop icon-color / icon-size /
    button-type / fixed-SizedBox-width assertions.
  * test/shared/widgets/mini_markdown_text_test.dart: Keep parser
    behaviour tests (bold/italic/link spans, tap recognizer,
    autolink).

- **Fix external links not opening on Android 11+**

  Buttons and links that should open a browser, mail client or dialer
  did nothing on Android. Starting with Android 11, apps must declare
  the intents they want to resolve via `<queries>` in the manifest;
  the previous manifest only declared `PROCESS_TEXT`, so
  `url_launcher`'s `canLaunchUrl` / `launchUrl` calls saw zero matching
  activities for `http` / `https` / `mailto` / `tel` and silently
  failed. The manifest now declares the standard `VIEW` intents for
  http and https, `SENDTO` for mailto, and `DIAL` for tel.

  * android/app/src/main/AndroidManifest.xml: Add `VIEW` (http, https),
    `SENDTO` (mailto), `DIAL` (tel) intents to the `<queries>` block.

## [0.30.0] - 2026-05-22

### Fixed

- **Stop the database from opening twice during startup**

  On cold start several providers may touch the `database` getter
  before the first `_initDatabase` future has settled. The previous
  cache-on-completion logic let each caller kick off its own open,
  and the second one would race `onUpgrade` and crash a non-idempotent
  migration (e.g. `ALTER TABLE … ADD COLUMN` saw the column already
  added by the first runner). The getter now single-flights: the
  first call assigns the in-flight future to `_opening`, every
  concurrent caller awaits the same future, and `_opening` is cleared
  on success (after `_database` is set) or on error (so a failed open
  can be retried).

  * lib/core/database/database_service.dart (DatabaseService.database,
    DatabaseService._opening): Replace the cache-on-completion getter
    with a single-flight pattern guarded by `_opening`.

### Added

- **Refresh a collection item from its source API on demand**

  Item detail's ⋮ menu gains a "Refresh from source" action that
  re-fetches the metadata and cover from IGDB (games), TMDB (movies,
  TV, animation), AniList (anime, manga) or VNDB (visual novels),
  upserts the fresh row into the cache tables, and deletes the
  cached image so it re-downloads with the new URL. Useful when a
  cover gets corrupted during sync, the source updated metadata, or
  a backup restore left stale rows. Custom items are skipped (no
  external source). The action is single-tap, surfaces success /
  not-found / unsupported / failed states via snackbar, and
  invalidates the open detail and collection lists so the UI shows
  the new data without a manual refresh.

  * lib/features/collections/helpers/collection_actions.dart
    (CollectionActions.refreshItemFromApi, _refreshItemWork,
    _RefreshOutcome, _RefreshMessage): New shared action that
    dispatches by `mediaType`, swaps in the matching API client,
    and reports the outcome via a context-free helper so UI feedback
    happens behind a single `context.mounted` check.
  * lib/features/collections/screens/item_detail_screen.dart
    (_ItemDetailScreenState._refreshFromApi): Menu entry plus
    handler that invalidates `collectionItemsNotifierProvider` after
    a successful refresh.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb (refreshItemFromApi,
    refreshItemSuccess, refreshItemNotFound, refreshItemUnsupported,
    refreshItemFailed): New strings; regenerated
    `app_localizations*.dart`.

### Added

- **Select all visible items from the bulk action bar**

  After picking at least one item, a "Select all" text button appears
  in the bulk action bar next to the "N selected" counter. Tapping it
  extends the selection to every item currently visible after search
  and filters, so a "find then select everything matching" flow
  becomes one tap instead of clicking each card. The button hides
  when the visible set is already fully selected or when the host
  screen doesn't expose a visible-item count.

  * lib/features/collections/widgets/bulk_action_bar.dart
    (BulkActionBar): Add `visibleCount` and `onSelectAllVisible`
    parameters; render a `TextButton` between the counter and the
    existing actions when the callback is set and
    `visibleCount > items.length`.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_screen/collection_bulk_action_bar.dart
    (CollectionBulkActionBar): Accept `CollectionFilters? filters`
    and `List<CollectionTag> tags`, apply them to the full item list
    to derive the visible set, and wire the new callback to
    `CollectionSelectionNotifier.selectAll`.
  * lib/features/collections/screens/collection_screen.dart
    (_CollectionScreenState.build): Lift `CollectionFilters` and
    tags resolution above the bulk action bar so the bar gets the
    same filtered set as `CollectionItemsView`.
  * lib/features/home/screens/all_items_screen.dart
    (AllItemsScreen.build): Compute `visibleItems` via
    `_applyFilter` once, pass to the bulk action bar with
    `AllItemsSelectionNotifier.selectAll`, and reuse the same list
    inside `itemsAsync.when` instead of filtering twice.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb (bulkSelectAllVisible):
    New label string; regenerated `app_localizations*.dart`.
  * test/features/collections/widgets/bulk_action_bar_test.dart: New.
    Cover the show/hide branches for the Select all button and
    confirm the callback fires on tap.

- **Reflect active filters in All Items media-type chevron counts**

  Counts shown next to each chevron on the home screen now drop and
  rise with the search query, status, platform and tag filters, so
  it's obvious how many of each type are currently visible. The
  "Hide empty media types" setting still keys off raw totals — a
  search that wipes out a category no longer makes the chevron itself
  disappear, matching how the collection filter bar already worked.

  * lib/features/home/screens/all_items_screen.dart
    (AllItemsScreen._applyFilter, AllItemsScreen._matchesNonTypeFilters,
    AllItemsScreen._countByMediaType, AllItemsScreen._rawTotalsByMediaType,
    AllItemsScreen._buildMediaTypeBar): Split filtering into a shared
    non-type predicate; chevron labels use a filter-aware count while
    chevron visibility under `hideEmptyMediaTypeChevrons` uses raw
    per-type totals.
  * test/features/home/screens/all_items_screen_test.dart
    (_FakeSettingsNotifier, "should keep chevrons with non-zero totals
    visible even when search filters them out"): Add a regression test
    that drives the search provider to a non-matching query and
    asserts the Games / Movies chevrons stay mounted.

### Changed

- **Split IgdbApi god class into layered files under `core/api/igdb/`**

  The 770-line `IgdbApi` is now a thin facade that delegates to four focused
  sub-APIs (transport+auth, games, platforms, genres) plus a shared types
  file. Public method signatures, constructor, provider and exception types
  are preserved 1:1, so all 18 call sites and 9 test files keep working
  without changes. Same pattern as the earlier AniList split.

  * lib/core/api/igdb_api.dart (IgdbApi): Rewritten as a facade that
    forwards `setCredentials`, `clearCredentials`, `getAccessToken`,
    `validateCredentials`, `fetchPlatforms`, `fetchPlatformsByIds`,
    `searchGames`, `multiSearchGamesByName`, `lookupSteamGames`,
    `getGameById`, `getGamesByIds`, `getTopGamesByPlatform`, `browseGames`,
    `fetchGenres`, `dispose`, `onTokenRefreshed` and `maxMultiQueryBatch`
    to the sub-APIs.
  * lib/core/api/igdb/igdb_http_client.dart (IgdbHttpClient): New.
    Owns Dio, credential state, Twitch OAuth (`getAccessToken`,
    `validateCredentials`), `post` with retry-on-401, `_tryRefreshToken`
    guarded by `_isRefreshing`, `handleDioException`, `ensureCredentials`.
  * lib/core/api/igdb/igdb_games_api.dart (IgdbGamesApi): New. Holds
    `_gameFields`, `maxMultiQueryBatch`, `_multiSearchLimit`,
    `_steamSource` and all game-domain methods.
  * lib/core/api/igdb/igdb_platforms_api.dart (IgdbPlatformsApi),
    igdb_genres_api.dart (IgdbGenresApi),
    igdb_types.dart (TwitchAuthResult, IgdbApiException,
    IgdbTokenRefreshedCallback): New, extracted as-is.
  * lib/core/api/igdb/README.md: New. Documents the layer breakdown and
    callouts on OAuth refresh, multiquery cap, Steam two-step lookup.

- **Replace raw collection dropdowns with the shared picker field**

  All places where the user picked one collection from a form
  (import screens for MAL / AniList / Trakt / Steam /
  RetroAchievements, in-app `.xcoll` import on the home screen,
  tier-list creation, browse-collections settings, mood grid
  picker) now use a single `CollectionPickerField` styled like the
  rest of the project's inputs. Tapping it opens the same
  collection-picker dialog used by the bulk "Move/Copy to
  collection" actions, so list overflow, sorting and search now
  behave consistently and the dialog no longer spills past the
  parent dialog edges. The mood-grid case additionally exposes an
  "All collections" entry via the new `nullLabel` / `nullIcon`
  options on the picker, which the underlying dialog renders with
  its own icon so it doesn't blur into the "Without Collection"
  tile.

  * lib/shared/widgets/collection_picker_field.dart
    (CollectionPickerField): New. Form-field shell that delegates
    to `showCollectionPickerDialog`, supports the optional
    `nullLabel` / `nullSubtitle` / `nullIcon` flow for "any/all"
    semantics and reactively renders the selected collection's
    name + author from `collectionsProvider`.
  * lib/shared/widgets/collection_picker_dialog.dart
    (showCollectionPickerDialog, _CollectionPickerContent,
    _CollectionPickerContentState._buildUncategorizedTile,
    _CollectionPickerContentState._buildLeadingIcon,
    _CollectionPickerContentState._buildIconBox): Accept optional
    `uncategorizedLabel` / `uncategorizedSubtitle` /
    `uncategorizedIcon` overrides and extract `_buildIconBox` so
    the relabelled tile no longer reuses the default "Uncategorized"
    subtitle or inbox icon.
  * lib/features/collections/screens/home_screen.dart,
    lib/features/settings/content/mal_import_content.dart,
    lib/features/settings/content/anilist_import_content.dart,
    lib/features/settings/content/trakt_import_content.dart,
    lib/features/settings/content/steam_import_content.dart,
    lib/features/settings/content/ra_import_content.dart,
    lib/features/settings/content/browse_collections_content.dart,
    lib/features/tier_lists/widgets/create_tier_list_dialog.dart:
    Drop the local `DropdownButton` / `DropdownButtonFormField` and
    its `DropdownMenuItem` wiring; route the selection through
    `CollectionPickerField`.
  * lib/features/tier_lists/widgets/mood_grid_item_picker.dart
    (MoodGridItemPickerState): Same migration, with `nullLabel`
    set to `l.moodGridPickerAllCollections` so the "All
    Collections" sentinel keeps its semantics.
  * test/shared/widgets/collection_picker_field_test.dart: New.
    Cover hint vs. selected vs. "all" rendering and verify a
    disabled field swallows taps.

- **Drop the author suffix from the mood-grid watermark**

  Mood-grid exports now read "made by Tonkatsu Box" without the
  trailing "— $authorName", matching the tier-list watermark.

  * lib/features/tier_lists/widgets/mood_grid_export_view.dart
    (MoodGridExportView, MoodGridExportView.authorName): Remove
    the `authorName` field and the conditional suffix.
  * lib/features/tier_lists/screens/mood_grid_detail_screen.dart:
    Stop reading `settingsNotifierProvider.authorName` and drop
    the now-unused `settings_provider` import.

- **Label bulk-move/copy leftovers as "Duplicates" instead of "Skipped"**

  A move or copy can only "skip" an item when the target already
  holds the same `(media_type, external_id)` pair (the UNIQUE index
  rejects the write). The previous wording made the count look like
  an opaque failure; renaming surfaces the real reason.

  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb (bulkResult): Replace
    "Skipped" / "Пропущено" with "Duplicates" / "Дубликаты"; sync
    `app_localizations_en.dart` and `app_localizations_ru.dart`.

- **Split the AniList API god class into layered files**

  `anilist_api.dart` (1409 LOC) is now a thin facade that owns a
  `Dio` and delegates to four single-responsibility services under
  `lib/core/api/anilist/`. GraphQL strings, exception types, the
  Dio transport, media parsing, MAL→AniList lookup and user-list
  fetching each get their own file (≤220 LOC), and the duplicated
  `AniListAnimeGenreFilter` collapses into `AniListGenreFilter` via
  a `forAnime` flag. Field selection in every query drops the
  unused `meanScore`, `popularity`, `season`, `seasonYear`,
  `countryOfOrigin` and `nextAiringEpisode.airingAt` to save
  bandwidth. The public API (`AniListApi`, `aniListApiProvider`,
  exceptions, `AniListListEntry`, `AniListMalLookupResult`,
  `fetchUserMediaList`, MAL lookup variants) stays unchanged — no
  caller had to be touched.

  * lib/core/api/anilist_api.dart (AniListApi): 1409 LOC → 132.
    Now constructs `AniListGraphQLClient` once and forwards every
    method to `AniListMediaApi`, `AniListMalLookupApi` or
    `AniListUserListApi`. Re-exports types via
    `export 'anilist/anilist_types.dart'` so existing imports keep
    working.
  * lib/core/api/anilist/anilist_graphql_client.dart
    (AniListGraphQLClient.post, AniListGraphQLClient.unwrapData,
    AniListGraphQLClient.logErrors,
    AniListGraphQLClient._mapDioException,
    AniListGraphQLClient._parseRetryAfter): New. The single place
    that talks to `https://graphql.anilist.co` and converts
    `DioException` into typed AniList exceptions.
  * lib/core/api/anilist/anilist_queries.dart (AniListQueries,
    aniListMaxPerPage, aniListBatches): New. Holds the eight
    GraphQL strings as `static const`, the shared
    `perPage` cap, and the shared batching iterator reused by both
    media and MAL lookups.
  * lib/core/api/anilist/anilist_media_parser.dart
    (AniListMediaParser.animePage, AniListMediaParser.mangaPage,
    AniListMediaParser.fuzzyDate): New. Pure
    `Page { media }` decoders plus fuzzy-date parsing.
  * lib/core/api/anilist/anilist_media_api.dart (AniListMediaApi.searchManga,
    AniListMediaApi.browseManga, AniListMediaApi.browseAnime,
    AniListMediaApi.getMangaById, AniListMediaApi.getAnimeById,
    AniListMediaApi.getMangaByIds, AniListMediaApi.getAnimeByIds):
    New. Search, browse and id-lookup endpoints for both media
    types.
  * lib/core/api/anilist/anilist_mal_lookup_api.dart
    (AniListMalLookupApi.getAnimeByMalIds,
    AniListMalLookupApi.getMangaByMalIds,
    AniListMalLookupApi.getAnimeByMalIdsTolerant,
    AniListMalLookupApi.getMangaByMalIdsTolerant,
    AniListMalLookupApi._runBatchWithRetry): New. Holds the
    rate-limit retry loop and the failed-id bookkeeping that the
    MAL importer relies on.
  * lib/core/api/anilist/anilist_user_list_api.dart
    (AniListUserListApi.fetchUserMediaList,
    AniListUserListApi._translateUserErrors,
    AniListUserListApi._parseListEntry): New. `MediaListCollection`
    fetcher, custom-list dedup and `isAdult` filter.
  * lib/core/api/anilist/anilist_types.dart (AniListApiException,
    AniListRateLimitException, AniListUserNotFoundException,
    AniListPrivateProfileException, AniListMalLookupResult,
    AniListListEntry): New. Exceptions and data classes shared by
    every layer.
  * lib/core/api/anilist/README.md: New. Layer map, AniList docs
    link, batching/rate-limit/error-mapping notes.
  * lib/features/search/filters/anilist_genre_filter.dart
    (AniListGenreFilter): Accepts `forAnime` and switches
    `cacheKey` between `genre_anilist_anime` and `genre_anilist`.
  * lib/features/search/filters/anilist_anime_genre_filter.dart
    (AniListAnimeGenreFilter): Removed; the manga and anime
    variants shared 69 identical lines apart from `cacheKey`.
  * lib/features/search/sources/anilist_anime_source.dart
    (AniListAnimeSource.filters): Use
    `AniListGenreFilter(forAnime: true)` instead of the deleted
    sibling class.
  * lib/shared/models/anime.dart (Anime.fromJson),
    lib/shared/models/manga.dart (Manga.fromJson): Stop reading
    `meanScore`, `popularity`, `season`, `seasonYear`,
    `nextAiringEpisode.airingAt` (anime) and `countryOfOrigin`
    (manga). The fields and their DB columns stay nullable for
    backward compatibility with existing rows.
  * test/shared/models/anime_test.dart,
    test/shared/models/manga_test.dart: Drop the assertions for
    fields that no longer round-trip through `fromJson`.
  * test/features/search/filters/anilist_genre_filter_test.dart:
    Add a case for `forAnime: true` producing the anime cacheKey.

- **Split the wishlist screen god class**

  `_WishlistScreenState` shed its tag-header chrome, item tile, and
  AlertDialog boilerplate into reusable units under `widgets/`. Four
  repeated confirm/prompt dialogs collapse to one shared `_confirm`
  helper in `WishlistDialogs`. The tile's right-click / long-press
  context menu loses its string-keyed `case 'search' / 'edit' / ...`
  switch and now dispatches on a typed enum, matching the
  `_TagMenuChoice` sealed-class pattern that already lived in this
  file.

  * lib/features/wishlist/screens/wishlist_screen.dart
    (_WishlistScreenState): 994 LOC → 345. Extract `_promptTagForBulk`,
    `_promptRenameTag`, `_confirmDeleteTag`, `_confirmClearResolved`,
    inline delete-item confirm, and bulk-delete confirm to
    `WishlistDialogs`. Inline `_BulkAction` becomes public
    `WishlistBulkAction` exported by the header widget. Notifier calls
    + filter state updates stay on the screen so dialog helpers remain
    pure.
  * lib/features/wishlist/widgets/wishlist_dialogs.dart (WishlistDialogs.promptBulkTag,
    promptRenameTag, confirmDeleteTag, confirmClearResolved,
    confirmDeleteItem, confirmBulkDelete, _confirm): New. Each returns
    the user's pick and never touches the wishlist provider.
  * lib/features/wishlist/widgets/wishlist_tag_header.dart
    (WishlistTagHeader, WishlistBulkAction, _TagPickerSegment,
    _BulkActionsSegment, _TagMenuChoice, _TagMenuFilter, _TagMenuRename,
    _TagMenuDelete): New. Hosts the chevron filter bar + bulk-action
    dropdown previously inlined.
  * lib/features/wishlist/widgets/wishlist_tile.dart (WishlistTile,
    _TileAction): New. Context menu uses a typed `_TileAction` enum.

- **Split the create-custom-item dialog god class**

  `_CreateCustomItemDialogState` (~700 LOC) sheds the cover image
  preview / picker, the two private dialogs (searchable list and
  multi-select genre), and the form-result data class into focused
  files under `widgets/custom_item/`. The dialog's dead "My rating"
  star section is removed — `_userRating` was collected but never
  reached `CustomItemData`, so nothing was ever saved.

  * lib/features/collections/widgets/create_custom_item_dialog.dart
    (_CreateCustomItemDialogState): 1089 LOC → 538. Replace
    `_buildCoverPreview`, `_buildCoverPlaceholder`, `_pickCoverImage`
    with `CustomCoverPreview` and `pickCustomCoverImage`. Drop
    `_userRating` and `_buildRatingSection` (dead code). Re-export
    `CustomItemData` from its new home so call sites keep working.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/custom_item/custom_item_data.dart
    (CustomItemData), cover_image_picker.dart (pickCustomCoverImage,
    CustomCoverPreview, CoverPickResult), searchable_list_dialog.dart
    (SearchableListDialog), multi_select_genre_dialog.dart
    (MultiSelectGenreDialog): New.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb (customItemMyRating):
    Removed — the rating UI it labelled was deleted as dead code.
    Regenerated `app_localizations*.dart`.

- **Replace draggable FAB fan menu with a labeled pill stack**

  The popup menu attached to every draggable FAB no longer fans small
  unlabeled circles around the ⋮ button; it opens as a vertical column
  of [text + icon] pills anchored to the FAB's right edge. Each action's
  full localised label is visible inline, removing the touch-device
  reliance on tooltips. The stack scrolls within the available vertical
  room (minus the system status bar / nav bar) when there are more
  items than fit, and flips to opening downward if there's more room
  below the FAB. The tier-lists screen's create FAB also changes
  `Icons.leaderboard` → `Icons.add` so the trigger reads as "add" rather
  than "stats".

  * lib/shared/widgets/draggable_fab.dart (_FanMenuPage, _PillButton,
    _PillButtonState): Replace the radial `_FanMenuPage` (circular
    `_FanButton` icons distributed around the FAB) with a pill-stack
    layout. `_buildAnimatedPill` staggers each entry; the column is
    wrapped in `SingleChildScrollView` constrained by
    `MediaQuery.viewPaddingOf(context)` so it stays clear of system
    chrome. Drops `_FanButton` / `_FanButtonState` and the `dart:math`
    import that was only needed for the fan's angle math.
  * lib/features/tier_lists/screens/tier_lists_screen.dart
    (_TierListsScreenState.build): FAB main action icon
    `Icons.leaderboard` → `Icons.add`.

- **Lazy-render the collection table and react chevron counts to the active status**

  Opening a 500+ item collection in table mode no longer freezes ~500ms:
  the table body is now a `SliverList.builder` (and `SliverReorderableList`
  in manual sort) embedded in a shared `CustomScrollView`, so only the
  rows in the viewport are built. The type chevron bar above the table
  also reacts to the active status filter — picking "Completed" in the
  dropdown or cycling the in-table Status column reflects in the per-type
  counts. Chevrons that were visible before the filter stay visible even
  if their filtered count is zero, so the bar no longer jumps.

  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_table/collection_table_view.dart
    (CollectionTableView, _CollectionTableViewState._buildSortableSliver,
    _buildReorderableSliver, initState, didUpdateWidget): Replace
    `ListView.builder(shrinkWrap, NeverScrollable)` /
    `ReorderableListView.builder` with `SliverList.builder` /
    `SliverReorderableList`. Accept `heroHeader` so the collection hero
    becomes the first sliver, drop the outer `_withHeader(wrapInScroll)`
    wrapper. Outer horizontal scroll only kicks in when `maxWidth < 864`.
    Add `onFilterStatusChanged` callback, sync to null on mount and on
    items-identity change so the parent screen never holds a stale
    column-header filter.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_items_view.dart
    (CollectionItemsView, onTableFilterStatusChanged): Forward the
    table's status filter outward; drop `_withHeader` for table mode.
  * lib/features/collections/screens/collection_screen.dart
    (_CollectionScreenState._tableFilterStatus,
    _effectiveStatusForChevrons): Track the table column's status filter
    separately so the chevron bar reflects it; the dropdown still shows
    only the dropdown-selected status.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_filter_bar.dart
    (CollectionFilterBar.effectiveStatusForCounts,
    _CollectionFilterBarState._typeCounts, _totalCountFor): Split
    "visibility" (uses `CollectionStats` totals) from "displayed count"
    (filtered by status) so chevrons don't disappear when the filter
    zeroes a type.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_filter_sheet.dart,
    lib/features/settings/widgets/settings_group.dart: Wrap the
    decorated body in `Material(type: MaterialType.transparency)` so
    descendant `ListTile` / `RadioListTile` widgets find a Material
    ancestor before the styled `DecoratedBox` / `Container`, silencing
    "ListTile background color or ink splashes may be invisible".
  * test/features/collections/widgets/collection_table_view_test.dart:
    Drop the `find.byType(ListView)` assertion (sliver-based view no
    longer exposes one); rely on `takeException()` for the render-empty
    check.

- **Widen the collection table Status column**

  Status labels like "Backlog", "Want to watch", "Completed" no longer
  truncate to the leading icon. The column grows 96 → 140 px in both
  header and rows; the table's minimum width before horizontal scroll
  bumps 820 → 864 to keep everything aligned.

  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_table/table_header.dart,
    lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_table/table_row.dart:
    Status column width 96 → 140.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_table/collection_table_view.dart
    (_CollectionTableViewState._minTableWidth): 820 → 864.

- **Split the collection screen god class and unify the error state**

  The 984-line `_CollectionScreenState` shed its FAB tower, the bulk-action
  bar, the error state, the create-tier-list dialog, and the filter logic
  into reusable units under `widgets/collection_screen/`,
  `widgets/dialogs/`, and `helpers/`. The string-typed menu dispatch
  (`'custom_item'`, `'rename'`, …) became a `CollectionMenuAction` enum
  with an exhaustive switch. The new `CollectionErrorState` widget also
  replaces the byte-identical `_buildErrorState` that the collections home
  screen carried, so both screens now share a single retry view.

  * lib/features/collections/screens/collection_screen.dart
    (_CollectionScreenState._toggleLock, _handleMenuAction): 984 lines → 757.
    Lock toggle and menu dispatch became named handlers; the FAB builders,
    bulk-action Consumer, error state, and tier-list dialog moved out.
  * lib/features/collections/screens/home_screen.dart
    (_CollectionsHomeScreenState._buildErrorState): Removed — replaced
    inline with `CollectionErrorState`.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_screen/collection_screen_fab.dart
    (CollectionScreenFab, CollectionMenuAction): New widget owning the
    main FAB, primary action row, and secondary action list; the menu
    callback now takes a typed enum instead of a string.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_screen/collection_bulk_action_bar.dart
    (CollectionBulkActionBar): New ConsumerWidget that watches selection
    and items, short-circuits when empty, and renders `BulkActionBar`.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_screen/collection_error_state.dart
    (CollectionErrorState): New shared error view used by both the
    collection screen and the collections home screen.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/dialogs/create_tier_list_dialog.dart
    (CreateTierListDialog.show): New helper — returns the trimmed name and
    disposes its `TextEditingController` via `whenComplete`.
  * lib/features/collections/helpers/collection_filters.dart
    (CollectionFilters, CollectionFilters.apply): New value type that
    holds the four filter sets plus the search query; pure function
    extracted from `_applyFilters`.

- **Split the item detail screen god class and drop the Activity & Progress wrapper**

  The 1488-line `_ItemDetailScreenState` shed seven independent widgets into
  `widgets/item_detail/`: the AppBar with its popup menu, the canvas pane
  with its SteamGridDB and VGMaps side panels, the media-config + chips
  builder, the RA badge, the pulsing RA link, the uncategorized banner,
  and the seasons-info row. The two near-duplicate
  "add from recommendations" handlers (movie / TV show) collapsed into one
  parameterised method. The ExpansionTile wrapper titled "Activity &
  Progress" disappeared too — each inner section (episode tracker, manga /
  anime progress, seasons info) already carries its own header, and the
  outer chrome only duplicated the activity-dates row just above it.

  * lib/features/collections/screens/item_detail_screen.dart
    (_ItemDetailScreenState._toggleLock, _handleMenuAction, _addRecommendation):
    1488 lines → 759. Lock toggle and popup-menu dispatch became named
    handlers; `_addMovieFromRecommendations` / `_addTvShowFromRecommendations`
    now delegate to a single generic helper parameterised by media type,
    `ownMapProvider`, and an `upsert` callback.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/item_detail/item_detail_app_bar.dart
    (ItemDetailAppBar, ItemDetailMenuAction): New PreferredSize widget
    owning the lock / canvas / edit-custom buttons and the refresh /
    rename / move / clone / remove popup menu.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/item_detail/item_detail_canvas_view.dart
    (ItemDetailCanvasView, _AnimatedSidePanel): New ConsumerWidget that
    holds the canvas plus the two animated side panels and unifies the
    SteamGridDB / VGMaps "add image" handlers behind a shared `_addImage`.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/item_detail/item_detail_media_config.dart
    (ItemDetailMediaConfig, ItemDetailMediaConfig.from): New value type
    plus factory that builds cover URL, type label, info chips, backdrop,
    and progress flags off a `CollectionItem` + `BuildContext`.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/item_detail/item_detail_ra_badge.dart
    (ItemDetailRaBadge): New ConsumerWidget that watches
    `trackerDetailProvider` and `raApiProvider` and renders the linked-RA
    logo, the pulsing link CTA, or `SizedBox.shrink()`.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/item_detail/pulsing_ra_link.dart
    (PulsingRaLink), seasons_info.dart (SeasonsInfo),
    uncategorized_banner.dart (UncategorizedBanner): Extracted leaf
    widgets — previously private nested classes / build methods.
  * lib/shared/widgets/media_detail_view.dart
    (_MediaDetailViewState._buildExtraSectionsExpansion): Removed.
    `extraSections` now render inline with the same spacing as siblings.
  * test/features/collections/screens/item_detail_screen_test.dart,
    test/shared/widgets/media_detail_view_test.dart: Dropped the
    `expandExtraSections` tap helper and the "Activity & Progress" text
    assertions to match the new inline layout.

- **Refactor canvas dialogs and load the board in two phases**

  The 800-line `_CanvasViewState` shed all its dialog plumbing into a
  dedicated service; the remaining state class now only carries layout,
  gestures, and the build tree. The board also paints sooner: instead of
  blocking the first frame on the seven join queries that hydrate cover
  art and titles, it now renders a skeleton of positions and types as
  soon as the bare canvas rows are loaded, then swaps the hydrated items
  in on the next state tick. Personal (per-item) canvas uses the same
  two-phase shape for symmetry, even though its one-to-few items make
  the perf win negligible there.

  * lib/features/collections/widgets/canvas_item_actions.dart
    (CanvasItemActions.addText, CanvasItemActions.addImage,
    CanvasItemActions.addLink, CanvasItemActions.editItem,
    CanvasItemActions.editConnection): New service that owns the
    add/edit dialogs (text, image, link, edit-connection). Internal
    `_showAndApply` helper collapses the seven copies of the
    show-dialog → null-check → `context.mounted` check →
    forward-to-controller pattern.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/canvas_view.dart
    (_CanvasViewState): Removed `_handleAddText`, `_handleAddImage`,
    `_handleAddLink`, `_handleEditItem`, `_editTextItem`,
    `_editImageItem`, `_editLinkItem`, `_handleEditConnection`
    (~120 lines). Call sites in `_onCanvasSecondaryTap`,
    `_onItemSecondaryTap`, `_showConnectionContextMenu` now delegate
    to a `late final` `_actions` field.
  * lib/data/repositories/canvas_repository.dart
    (CanvasRepository.enrichItems): New public wrapper around the
    existing `_enrichItemsWithMediaData`. Lets callers split skeleton
    load from media hydration without exposing the private method.
  * lib/features/collections/providers/canvas_provider.dart
    (CanvasNotifier._loadCanvas, CanvasNotifier._loadGeneration),
    lib/features/collections/providers/game_canvas_provider.dart
    (GameCanvasNotifier._loadCanvas, GameCanvasNotifier._loadGeneration):
    Two-phase load — phase 1 fetches positions / viewport / connections
    in parallel and updates state with `isLoading: false`, phase 2
    calls `enrichItems` and swaps in the hydrated list. A
    `_loadGeneration` counter discards phase-2 results from a load
    that was superseded by another reload.

- **Fix canvas regressions on first init, FAB overlap, and stale side-panel state**

  Anime and custom items on a freshly-created board used to open with
  empty cards (no cover, no title) because `CanvasItem.copyWith` in
  the init path silently dropped the `anime` and `customMedia` fields
  while accepting game / movie / TV show. Reloading the canvas hid the
  bug because the read path enriches from cache; first-render was the
  only window. The collection screen's ⋮ FAB also got moved inward
  on canvas mode so it stops landing on top of the canvas-side
  toolbar buttons (VgMaps, SteamGridDB, center-view, reset). And the
  SteamGridDB / VgMaps side panels stop carrying their previous search
  and browser state across canvases — both providers are keyed by
  `collectionId`, so per-item canvases inside the same collection used
  to inherit each other's queries until the panel was closed.

  * lib/data/repositories/canvas_repository.dart
    (CanvasRepository.initializeCanvas): Copy `anime` and
    `customMedia` through to the freshly-created `CanvasItem`s.
  * lib/features/collections/providers/game_canvas_provider.dart
    (GameCanvasNotifier._initializeWithCollectionItem): Copy `anime`
    through to the per-item canvas item.
  * lib/shared/widgets/draggable_fab.dart (DraggableFab.initialRight,
    DraggableFab.initialBottom): New constructor params let callers
    pre-position the FAB without breaking the user's drag-to-relocate
    state.
  * lib/features/collections/screens/collection_screen.dart
    (_CollectionScreenState.build): Pass `initialRight: 72` while in
    canvas mode and key the `DraggableFab` on `_isCanvasMode` so the
    position resets cleanly when the user toggles modes.
  * test/data/repositories/canvas_repository_test.dart
    (CanvasRepository.initializeCanvas should propagate every
    media-type field from CollectionItem): New table-driven test that
    walks every media-type-specific field. Adding a new media type
    requires adding a row here, so the «one type silently forgotten»
    class of bug can't reappear.
  * test/features/collections/providers/game_canvas_provider_test.dart:
    New file mirroring the same propagation check for the per-item
    canvas (seven media types, seven tests).
  * test/features/collections/providers/canvas_provider_test.dart:
    Updated mocks to cover the new `enrichItems` and the split
    `getItems`/`getGameCanvasItems` calls in the two-phase load.
  * lib/features/collections/providers/steamgriddb_panel_provider.dart
    (SteamGridDbPanelNotifier.closePanel): Reset search input,
    results, selection, and current images on close while preserving
    `imageCache`. Translated the file's dartdocs to English while
    touching it.
  * lib/features/collections/providers/vgmaps_panel_provider.dart
    (VgMapsPanelNotifier.closePanel): Reset to a fresh
    `VgMapsPanelState` on close so the captured image URL and the
    last-visited page don't bleed into the next canvas. Translated
    dartdocs to English.
  * test/features/collections/providers/steamgriddb_panel_provider_test.dart,
    test/features/collections/providers/vgmaps_panel_provider_test.dart:
    Add a regression test per panel that confirms `closePanel` wipes
    the search/browser side of the state and (for SteamGridDB) keeps
    `imageCache`.

- **Split search screen god class into per-source handlers and fix animation routing**

  `_SearchScreenState` shrank from ~1500 to ~400 lines. The seven near-duplicate
  blocks (`_onXTap` / `_addXToCollection` / `_addXToAnyCollection` /
  `_showXDetails`) per media type were extracted into focused handler classes
  sharing a `SearchCollectionAdder` that owns the picker → upsert → addItem →
  image cache → snackbar pipeline. The registry resolves handlers by item
  runtime type and supports a `registerForSource` override so the same model
  (e.g. `Game` from a future RAWG source) can plug in source-specific logic
  without touching the screen.

  Along the way three pre-existing animation-routing bugs were fixed. Every
  `SearchSource` now declares a fixed `outputMediaType`, which the grid and
  the Discover feed both consume — replacing hardcoded `MediaType.movie /
  tvShow` plus a per-item `_isAnimation(genres)` heuristic that silently
  misclassified TMDB items. As a result on the Animation tab both movies
  and TV shows now save as `MediaType.animation` (Discover-feed adds went
  in as `movie/tvShow` before). Lastly `isAnimationGenre` became locale-
  and case-aware: TMDB returns `"мультфильм"` (lowercase) for `ru-RU`, but
  our DAO capitalises the first letter on read, so the filter dropped
  every animation row — `«Аватар: Легенда об Аанге»` was missing from the
  Animation tab and simultaneously leaked into TV shows.

  * lib/features/search/services/search_collection_adder.dart
    (SearchCollectionAdder.addToCollection, SearchCollectionAdder.pickCollection,
    SearchCollectionAdder.collectedCollectionIdsAcross, PickedCollection):
    New shared service de-duplicating the add-to-collection pipeline; honours
    `context.mounted` between async hops. `collectedCollectionIdsAcross`
    unions two collected-id providers — replaces duplicated `Future.wait`
    blocks in Movie/TvShow handlers.
  * lib/features/search/handlers/media_action_handler.dart (MediaActionHandler):
    New flat (non-generic) contract — generics dropped to keep the registry
    type-erased; concrete handlers downcast internally.
  * lib/features/search/handlers/game_handler.dart (GameHandler),
    movie_handler.dart (MovieHandler), tv_show_handler.dart (TvShowHandler):
    New per-source handlers for the three media types with non-trivial logic.
    `MovieHandler` and `TvShowHandler` route both regular and
    `MediaType.animation` (with `AnimationSource.movie/tvShow` platform id);
    `TvShowHandler` keeps the post-add season/episode preload; `GameHandler`
    keeps the platform selection dialog.
  * lib/features/search/handlers/simple_media_handler.dart
    (SimpleMediaHandler): New generic single-source handler covering Anime,
    Manga, and VisualNovel — three near-identical handler files (~300 lines
    of duplication) collapsed into one parameterized class. Each model is
    wired in `MediaHandlers` via field extractors (`externalIdOf`,
    `titleOf`, `imageUrlOf`, `upsert`, `sheetBuilder`) and the matching
    `collected*IdsProvider`.
  * lib/features/search/handlers/media_handlers.dart (MediaHandlers,
    MediaHandlers.forItem, MediaHandlers.registerForSource, MediaHandlers.onTap,
    MediaHandlers.addToAnyCollection): New registry with two-level dispatch
    (`(sourceId, type)` then `type`).
  * lib/features/search/models/search_source.dart (SearchSource.outputMediaType):
    New abstract getter — each source declares the `MediaType` it produces
    so consumers no longer have to guess from runtime type or genres.
  * lib/features/search/sources/tmdb_movies_source.dart (TmdbMoviesSource.outputMediaType),
    tmdb_tv_source.dart (TmdbTvSource.outputMediaType),
    tmdb_anime_source.dart (TmdbAnimeSource.outputMediaType),
    igdb_games_source.dart (IgdbGamesSource.outputMediaType),
    anilist_anime_source.dart (AniListAnimeSource.outputMediaType),
    anilist_manga_source.dart (AniListMangaSource.outputMediaType),
    vndb_source.dart (VndbSource.outputMediaType): Override the getter
    with the source-declared `MediaType`.
  * lib/features/search/widgets/browse_grid.dart (BrowseGrid._buildCard):
    Use `state.source.outputMediaType` for every item branch; remove the
    `_isAnimation(TvShow)` helper, the per-item genre heuristic, and the
    `isAnimationGenre` import. Per-item `MediaType.movie/tvShow/game/...`
    hardcodes replaced with the parameterized `mediaType`.
  * lib/features/search/screens/search_screen.dart (_SearchScreenState,
    _SearchScreenState._buildContent): Removed all `_addX*` / `_onXTap` /
    `_showXDetails` methods (~1100 lines); `_onItemTap` now delegates to
    `MediaHandlers`. DiscoverFeed `onAddMovie`/`onAddTvShow` callbacks
    now use `browseState.source.outputMediaType` — previously hardcoded
    to `MediaType.movie`/`MediaType.tvShow`, which silently misclassified
    every recommendation added from the Animation tab.
  * lib/features/search/utils/genre_utils.dart (isAnimationGenre):
    Signature now `(String genre, Map<String, String> genreMap)` and the
    comparison is case-insensitive — matches the localised genre name
    returned by TMDB regardless of the DAO's `_capitalize` on read.
  * lib/features/search/sources/tmdb_anime_source.dart (TmdbAnimeSource._searchWithFilters),
    tmdb_tv_source.dart (TmdbTvSource.fetch): Pass the loaded `genreMap`
    to `isAnimationGenre`.
  * test/features/search/handlers/media_handlers_test.dart: New — locks down
    type-based dispatch, source-id override precedence, and the no-handler
    fallback.
  * test/features/search/handlers/tmdb_handlers_test.dart: New — covers the
    `MediaType.animation` branch of `MovieHandler`/`TvShowHandler`
    (verifies `platformId` becomes `AnimationSource.movie`/`tvShow`) and
    the TvShow post-add preload hook.
  * test/features/search/sources/source_output_media_type_test.dart: New —
    one-liner per source verifying the `outputMediaType` contract.
  * test/features/search/utils/genre_utils_test.dart: Extended for the new
    signature: localised genre map, case-insensitive matching, RU and EN
    samples.
  * test/features/search/models/search_source_test.dart (_TestSource.outputMediaType):
    Implement the new abstract getter on the in-test source.
  * test/helpers/fallbacks.dart (_FakeBuildContext): New mocktail fallback
    for `BuildContext`, needed by the handler tests.

- **Upgrade to Flutter 3.44.0 and fix table-view hero detachment**

  Bumps the project past the Flutter `onReorder → onReorderItem` rename so
  CI's `--fatal-infos` stops blocking release builds. The new callback
  adjusts `newIndex` internally for the removed-element offset, so the
  per-callsite `if (newIndex > oldIndex) newIndex -= 1` workaround is
  dropped. Three call sites of the new debug-only assertion
  «`ListTile` background color or ink splashes may be invisible» introduced
  by Flutter 3.44 are also rewired so descendants paint their ink on a
  proper Material ancestor. Finally the table-view hero banner stops
  «detaching» from the top of the screen on wide windows when the row
  count is small — the old `SingleChildScrollView` + `Column` mistakenly
  anchored its content to the bottom of the viewport on Flutter 3.44, so
  the wrap switches to a `CustomScrollView` mirroring the grid path.

  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_items_view.dart
    (CollectionItemsView._withHeader): Replace the inner
    `SingleChildScrollView(child: Column[header, body])` for table/reorder
    modes with a `CustomScrollView` of two `SliverToBoxAdapter`s. Hero
    stays glued to the top when content fits the viewport and still
    scrolls with the rows when it doesn't.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_items_view.dart,
    lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_table/collection_table_view.dart:
    Switch the inner `ReorderableListView.onReorder` to `onReorderItem`
    and drop the manual index normalisation.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/rich/rich_collection_body.dart
    (_HeroImage.build): `BoxFit.cover` + `Alignment.topCenter` so the
    hero `SizedBox` always paints fully — the previous `BoxFit.fitWidth`
    left transparent strips above and below very wide banner images.
  * lib/shared/theme/app_theme.dart (_OpaquePageTransitionsBuilder.buildTransitions):
    Wrap every route's child in a transparent `Material` so any descendant
    `ListTile`/`ExpansionTile` has an ink ancestor — the tiled background
    `DecoratedBox` no longer sits directly between Material and ListTile.
  * lib/shared/widgets/media_detail_view.dart (MediaDetailView.build):
    Hoist the outer card fill from `Container.decoration.color` to a
    wrapping `Material`; the inner `Container` keeps only the border and
    radius so it no longer shadows ink splashes from the embedded
    «Activity & Progress» `ExpansionTile`.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/steamgriddb_panel.dart
    (SteamGridDbPanel.build): Replace the outer `Container(color: ...)`
    with `SizedBox` + `Material`, fixing ink rendering for the search
    results `ListTile`s.
  * android/gradle.properties: Auto-added `android.builtInKotlin=false`
    and `android.newDsl=false` by Flutter migrator on upgrade to 3.44.
  * pubspec.lock: Bumped by `flutter upgrade` (Flutter 3.44.0 / Dart 3.12.0).

- **Surface the primary action of every floating menu as an always-visible button**

  The draggable FAB used to be a single ⋮ that hid every action — including
  "Add" — behind a tap. Each screen now ships a separate, always-visible
  primary button stacked under the ⋮ overflow so the most common action
  is one tap away: Add wishlist entry, Add profile, Create tier list,
  Add tier, Export mood grid image, New collection, Add items, Export
  gamepad log. The ⋮ stays for less-frequent operations and is rendered
  ~17% smaller above the primary button, with the fan menu now opening
  upward/leftward from it so it never overlaps the main button. The
  whole block drags together; tap targets are independent.

  * lib/shared/widgets/draggable_fab.dart (DraggableFab.mainAction,
    _DraggableFabState._buildButton, _DraggableFabState._blockWidth,
    _DraggableFabState._blockHeight, _DraggableFabState._showMenu): New
    `mainAction` parameter that renders an always-visible 48px button
    paired with a 40px ⋮ overflow. Each button hosts its own
    `GestureDetector` for tap routing while sharing pan state for the
    whole-block drag; menu anchor is computed from the ⋮ position so
    the fan radiates around it, not the main button.
  * lib/features/wishlist/screens/wishlist_screen.dart
    (_WishlistScreenState._buildAddItem, _buildFabItems): Add → main;
    toggle resolved + clear resolved stay under ⋮.
  * lib/features/settings/screens/profiles_screen.dart: Add profile →
    main; ⋮ is hidden when no other actions exist.
  * lib/features/tier_lists/screens/tier_lists_screen.dart: Create
    tier list → main; Create mood grid stays under ⋮.
  * lib/features/tier_lists/screens/tier_list_detail_screen.dart:
    Add tier → main; Export image + Clear all stay under ⋮.
  * lib/features/tier_lists/screens/mood_grid_detail_screen.dart:
    Export image → main; Rename + Delete stay under ⋮.
  * lib/features/collections/screens/home_screen.dart: New collection
    → main; Import / view toggle / sort stay under ⋮.
  * lib/features/collections/screens/collection_screen.dart
    (_CollectionScreenState._buildMainFabAction): Add items → main
    (only when editable and not in canvas mode); view toggles and
    secondary actions stay under ⋮.
  * lib/features/settings/screens/gamepad_debug_screen.dart: Export
    log → main; Clear logs stays under ⋮.

- **Make backup restore visibly atomic, faster, and impossible to interrupt by accident**

  Restoring a large backup used to look "done" while SQLite was still
  flushing the last collection's writes; closing the app at that point
  truncated the data. The restore flow now shows a modal,
  dismiss-locked progress dialog ("Restoring backup — do not close the
  app. This may take several minutes for large backups.") with a real
  per-collection counter and a final "Finishing up…" stage so the UI
  only goes away once the operation has actually returned. The
  `BackupProgress` callback is fired after each collection finishes
  (not before it starts), so the bar never claims completion ahead of
  the database write. On desktop, an `AppLifecycleListener` vetoes
  OS-level close requests for the duration of the restore (taskbar
  close, alt+F4), letting the user know to wait instead of corrupting
  data — kill -9 and power cuts still bypass this, but those are out
  of scope. At the very end of the restore the WAL is force-flushed
  via `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` so a user deleting the
  sidecar `-wal`/`-shm` files afterwards can't lose the tail-of-
  restore writes (wishlist + mood grids, which land last). The
  database now opens in WAL journal mode with
  `synchronous = NORMAL`, the SQLite-recommended durable-but-fast
  combination — restores (and every other write-heavy operation,
  including imports and canvas edits) run noticeably faster because
  commits batch into one fsync per checkpoint instead of one fsync
  per write.

  * lib/core/database/database_service.dart (DatabaseService._initDatabase):
    Issue `PRAGMA journal_mode = WAL` (via `rawQuery` — Android's
    SQLiteDatabase rejects PRAGMAs that return a result via `execute`)
    and `PRAGMA synchronous = NORMAL` in `onConfigure`. Single change,
    broad benefit — applies to every write the app makes, not just
    restore.
  * lib/core/services/backup_service.dart (BackupService,
    BackupService.restoreFromBackup, restoreInProgressProvider):
    Inject `DatabaseService` so the restore can issue a final
    `PRAGMA wal_checkpoint(TRUNCATE)` before returning; report
    `BackupProgress` after each collection import (so `current` only
    advances once the write is durable); emit a terminal
    `'finalizing'` stage before returning; expose a
    `StateProvider<bool>` that the app shell watches for the
    exit-veto.
  * lib/features/settings/screens/settings_screen.dart
    (_RestoreProgressDialog, _SettingsScreenState._handleRestore):
    Replace the loading snackbar with a `PopScope(canPop: false)`
    modal dialog driven by a `ValueNotifier<BackupProgress?>`; flip
    `restoreInProgressProvider` while the future is in flight.
  * lib/app.dart (TonkatsuBoxApp, _TonkatsuBoxAppState): Switch to
    `ConsumerStatefulWidget`; register an `AppLifecycleListener` whose
    `onExitRequested` returns `AppExitResponse.cancel` while
    `restoreInProgressProvider` is true.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb (restoreProgressTitle,
    restoreProgressWarning, restoreStageReading,
    restoreStageCollections, restoreStageWishlist,
    restoreStageSettings, restoreStageFinalizing): New strings;
    regenerated `app_localizations*.dart`.

### Added

- **Group wishlist entries with tags, bulk-delete by tag, and search inside notes**

  The wishlist now carries an optional `tag` per entry so bulk-imported
  batches can be grouped, filtered, and removed in one action instead
  of cleaned up one by one. Every importer that may dump unmatched
  rows into the wishlist — MyAnimeList, Steam, RetroAchievements,
  Trakt — stamps every wishlist row it adds with an auto-generated tag
  of shape `<source>-<unix-ms>` (`MyAnimeList-...`, `Steam-...`,
  `RetroAchievements-...`, `Trakt-...`), guaranteed unique per run —
  two imports back-to-back never merge into the same bucket. The wishlist
  screen gets a full-width chevron filter bar in the same visual language
  as the collection / search screens: left segment picks the active tag
  (popup lists every tag with per-bucket counts and, when a specific tag
  is selected, "Rename tag" / "Delete tag and all entries" actions);
  right segment is bulk-actions — apply a tag to every visible entry,
  strip the tag, or delete the visible subset (each with a confirmation
  dialog). The free-text search now matches the `note` field in addition
  to the title, so "find by comment, then mass-tag/delete" works as one
  flow. The add/edit form has a new optional "Tag" input so users can
  drop a new entry directly into an existing group. Backup archives
  include the new column so `.xcoll(x)` restore round-trips it.

  * lib/core/database/schema.dart (DatabaseSchema.createWishlistTable):
    Add `tag TEXT` column to fresh-install wishlist DDL.
  * lib/core/database/migrations/migration_v40.dart (MigrationV40),
    lib/core/database/migrations/migration_registry.dart: New v40
    migration that adds `tag` on upgrade.
  * lib/core/database/database_service.dart: Bump schema version to 40;
    extend wishlist facade with `tag` / `clearTag` plumbing,
    `deleteWishlistItemsByTag`, `renameWishlistTag`.
  * lib/core/database/dao/wishlist_dao.dart (WishlistDao.addWishlistItem,
    WishlistDao.updateWishlistItem, WishlistDao.getWishlistItemsFiltered,
    WishlistDao.deleteWishlistItemsByTag, WishlistDao.renameWishlistTag,
    WishlistTagCount): Tag-aware CRUD; new filtered query consumes the
    `WishlistTagFilter` sealed type.
  * lib/shared/models/wishlist_item.dart (WishlistItem.tag,
    WishlistItem.copyWith, WishlistItem.fromDb, WishlistItem.toDb):
    Carry the new field end-to-end.
  * lib/shared/models/wishlist_tag.dart (WishlistTagFilter,
    WishlistTagFilterAll, WishlistTagFilterUntagged,
    WishlistTagFilterNamed, WishlistTagInfo, buildImportTag,
    parseWishlistTag): New — sealed filter type plus
    `%source%-<unix-ms>` auto-tag builder and parser used by the UI to
    render auto-tags as "Source — date time".
  * lib/data/repositories/wishlist_repository.dart
    (WishlistRepository.add, WishlistRepository.getAll,
    WishlistRepository.update, WishlistRepository.deleteByTag,
    WishlistRepository.renameTag): Tag-aware passthroughs.
  * lib/features/wishlist/providers/wishlist_provider.dart
    (WishlistNotifier.add, WishlistNotifier.updateItem,
    WishlistNotifier.deleteByTag, WishlistNotifier.renameTag,
    WishlistNotifier.applyTagToIds, WishlistNotifier.deleteIds,
    wishlistTagsProvider): Tag-aware mutations + bulk operations on a
    set of ids + derived provider that aggregates per-tag counts in
    memory (Untagged first, then most recent named tag).
  * lib/features/wishlist/screens/wishlist_screen.dart
    (_WishlistScreenState._tagFilter, _WishlistScreenState._applyFilters,
    _WishlistScreenState._promptRenameTag,
    _WishlistScreenState._confirmDeleteTag,
    _WishlistScreenState._runBulkAction,
    _WishlistScreenState._promptTagForBulk, _WishlistTagHeader,
    _TagPickerSegment, _BulkActionsSegment, _TagMenuChoice, _BulkAction):
    Full-width chevron filter bar built on `DropdownChevronSegment`
    (consistent with collection / search screens); extend the in-memory
    filter to honor `_tagFilter` and match the search query against
    `note` as well as `text`; bulk-actions popup wires apply / remove /
    delete over the currently visible subset.
  * lib/features/wishlist/widgets/add_wishlist_dialog.dart
    (WishlistDialogResult.tag, _AddWishlistFormState._tagController):
    Optional Tag input field on add/edit.
  * lib/core/services/mal_import_service.dart (MalImportService.importFiles,
    MalImportService._addToWishlist), lib/core/services/steam_import_service.dart
    (SteamImportService.importLibrary, SteamImportService._addToWishlist),
    lib/core/services/ra_import_service.dart (RaImportService._addToWishlistIfNotExists),
    lib/core/services/trakt_zip_import_service.dart
    (TraktZipImportService.importFromZip): Generate one
    `buildImportTag(<source>)` per import run and pass it through to
    every unmatched entry; on re-import only stamp a tag onto
    previously-untagged duplicates so user-assigned tags are preserved.
  * lib/core/services/backup_service.dart (BackupService._wishlistItemToExport,
    BackupService._restoreWishlist): Persist and restore the new column
    in `.xcoll(x)` archives.

    wishlistTagHint, wishlistTagAll, wishlistTagUntagged,

    wishlistTagRename, wishlistTagDelete, wishlistTagDeleteConfirm,
    wishlistBulkActionsButton, wishlistBulkApplyTag,
    wishlistBulkApplyTagHint, wishlistBulkRemoveTag, wishlistBulkDelete,
    wishlistBulkDeleteConfirm, apply): New strings; regenerated
    `app_localizations*.dart`.
  * test/shared/models/wishlist_tag_test.dart: New — covers
    `buildImportTag` uniqueness, `parseWishlistTag` of auto-generated
    tags, multi-dash source names, manual tags, and trailing-dash /
    non-numeric edge cases.
  * test/core/services/mal_import_service_test.dart: Assert the
    auto-tag follows `MyAnimeList-<unix-ms>` and reaches
    `addWishlistItem`.

- **Harden MyAnimeList XML import against AniList rate limits and protect existing entries**

  Large MAL imports no longer dump everything into Wishlist when AniList
  throttles or hiccups mid-batch. Each AniList lookup batch now retries
  up to three times on HTTP 429, honoring `Retry-After` /
  `X-RateLimit-Reset` (falling back to the documented 60s window), and
  only the truly unresolvable ids are surfaced as a separate "skipped
  (AniList unreachable)" counter — those entries are left out of the
  collection so a future re-import can retry them, instead of being
  silently misclassified as wishlist items. The import progress UI
  shows the rate-limit countdown ("Лимит AniList достигнут — ждём
  N сек, попытка X/3") without resetting the global batch counter, and
  reports the skipped count alongside imported / wishlisted / updated.
  A new "Overwrite existing entries" toggle, off by default, protects
  user edits on re-import: matched items keep their local status,
  rating, progress, dates and comment; with the toggle on, the previous
  merge behaviour applies.

  * lib/core/api/anilist_api.dart (AniListApi.maxRateLimitRetries,
    AniListApi.getAnimeByMalIdsTolerant, AniListApi.getMangaByMalIdsTolerant,
    AniListRateLimitException, AniListMalLookupResult): New rate-limit aware
    lookup methods that return partial results plus a list of failed MAL
    ids, with `onRateLimit` / `onBatchProgress` callbacks so callers can
    surface wait countdowns. `_handleDioException` now parses retry
    headers and emits the typed `AniListRateLimitException`.
  * lib/core/services/mal_import_service.dart (MalImportService.importFiles,
    MalImportStage.rateLimitWait, MalImportProgress.failedLookupCount,
    MalImportProgress.rateLimitWaitSeconds, MalImportResult.animeFailedLookup,
    MalImportResult.mangaFailedLookup, MalImportResult.failedLookup):
    Switch to the tolerant lookups, track per-kind failed-lookup counts,
    propagate rate-limit progress without resetting the cumulative
    counter, and add the `overwriteExistingItems` parameter (default
    false) that bypasses `_updateExistingItem` so user data survives
    re-imports.
  * lib/features/settings/content/mal_import_content.dart
    (_MalImportContentState._overwriteExisting, _MalImportContentState._buildProgressSection):
    Add the "Overwrite existing entries" switch, render the new
    rateLimitWait stage with an indeterminate bar, and show the
    "skipped (AniList unreachable)" stat row.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb (malImportRateLimitWait,
    malImportFailedLookup, malImportOverwriteExisting,
    malImportOverwriteExistingHint): New strings; regenerated
    `app_localizations*.dart`.
  * test/core/services/mal_import_service_test.dart: Cover the tolerant
    lookup result shape, the failed-lookup-is-skipped path, and the
    `overwriteExistingItems=false` no-op-on-existing path; existing
    dedup test now explicitly passes `overwriteExistingItems: true`.

## [0.29.0] - 2026-05-16

### Added

- **Rename any collection item without touching the API cache**

  Open an item's detail screen, use the overflow menu (⋮) and pick
  "Rename" to give it a custom display name — "Final Fantasy VII Remake
  Intergrade" can become "FF7R" in your Favorites while keeping the
  original title in Wishlist or another collection. The original cached
  title is shown as a subtitle inside the dialog so you can see what
  you're overriding, and a "Reset to original" button clears the
  override. The custom name is per-collection-item: shared cache rows
  (games, movies_cache, tv_shows_cache, …) keep the canonical API title
  so future IGDB / TMDB / AniList / RA resyncs don't overwrite the
  user's choice. Canvas boards inherit the override too — the title
  under each card on the board follows the rename. Custom items already
  have a full Edit dialog, so the Rename action is hidden for them.
  Mood grids show the original cached name (cells reference media by
  external id only, no collection-item linkage to inherit from).

  * lib/core/database/schema.dart (DatabaseSchema.createCollectionItemsTable):
    Add `override_name TEXT` column on fresh installs.
  * lib/core/database/migrations/migration_v39.dart (MigrationV39),
    lib/core/database/migrations/migration_registry.dart: New v39 migration
    that adds the `override_name` column on upgrade.
  * lib/core/database/database_service.dart (DatabaseService.setItemOverrideName):
    Bump schema version to 39; facade for the new DAO method.
  * lib/core/database/dao/collection_dao.dart (CollectionDao.setItemOverrideName):
    Trims input and treats empty / whitespace-only as NULL so callers
    can use the same method for both rename and reset.
  * lib/data/repositories/collection_repository.dart
    (CollectionRepository.setItemOverrideName): Repository pass-through.
  * lib/shared/models/collection_item.dart (CollectionItem.overrideName,
    CollectionItem.cachedName, CollectionItem.itemName, CollectionItem.copyWith,
    CollectionItem.toDb, CollectionItem.fromDb, CollectionItem.toExport,
    CollectionItem.fromExport, CollectionItem.internalDbFields):
    New `overrideName` field threaded through fromDb / toDb / copyWith
    (with a `clearOverrideName` sentinel) and through the export round-trip.
    `itemName` returns `overrideName ?? cachedName ?? typed-fallback`; the
    new public `cachedName` getter exposes the original media title so the
    rename UI can show the user what they're overriding. `toExport` emits
    `override_name` only when `includeUserData` is true and the override
    is non-null.
  * lib/features/collections/providers/collections_provider.dart
    (CollectionItemsNotifier.setOverrideName): Trims and updates state in
    place via copyWith, invalidates `allItemsNotifierProvider` so the
    All Items screen reflects the rename.
  * lib/features/collections/providers/canvas_provider.dart
    (CanvasNotifier._syncOverrideNames): Listens to
    `collectionItemsNotifierProvider` and patches `overrideName` on live
    canvas items by `(itemType, itemRefId)` so the collection board's card
    title updates immediately after a rename without a full reload — same
    matching key as the SQL join in `canvas_dao.getCanvasItems`.
  * lib/features/collections/providers/game_canvas_provider.dart
    (GameCanvasNotifier._syncOverrideName): Per-item canvas has no
    structural sync loop, so an analogous listener patches `overrideName`
    on items whose `collectionItemId` matches the current canvas key.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/rename_item_dialog.dart
    (RenameItemDialog): New dialog with a pre-filled TextField, a subtitle
    showing the original cached name, and Save / Reset to original / Cancel
    buttons. Returns the trimmed text on Save, an empty string on Reset,
    null on Cancel. Content is wrapped in `SingleChildScrollView` and the
    subtitle uses `maxLines: 2 + ellipsis` so the dialog doesn't overflow
    on narrow screens or with long original titles.
  * lib/features/collections/screens/item_detail_screen.dart
    (_ItemDetailScreenState._renameItem, AppBar overflow menu):
    New menu entry "Rename" hidden for `MediaType.custom`. No SnackBar
    on success — the new title in the AppBar is confirmation enough.
  * lib/shared/models/canvas_item.dart (CanvasItem.overrideName,
    CanvasItem.mediaTitle, CanvasItem.copyWith, CanvasItem.fromDb):
    New transient `overrideName` field — loaded from a SQL join (never
    written back to `canvas_items`) and consulted first by `mediaTitle`.
    `copyWith` preserves it across media enrichment and accepts a
    `clearOverrideName` sentinel so live listeners can drop the override
    when a user resets the rename.
  * lib/core/database/dao/canvas_dao.dart (CanvasDao.getCanvasItems):
    Swap `db.query` for a `rawQuery` that pulls `override_name` from the
    matching `collection_items` row via a correlated subquery
    `(collection_id, media_type, external_id)` so canvas titles inherit
    the rename. Multi-platform games in the same collection share an
    override; the subquery picks any matching row with `LIMIT 1`.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb (renameItem, renameDialogHint,
    renameOriginalLabel, renameResetToOriginal, renameSaved): New
    localisation keys for the dialog and the menu entries.
  * test/shared/models/collection_item_test.dart,
    test/shared/models/canvas_item_test.dart,
    test/core/database/dao/collection_dao_test.dart,
    test/core/database/dao/canvas_dao_test.dart,
    test/features/collections/providers/collections_provider_test.dart,
    test/features/collections/widgets/rename_item_dialog_test.dart:
    Round-trip, copyWith semantics, DAO trim / empty / whitespace / null
    branches, notifier state mutation, dialog Save / Reset / Cancel
    behaviour, and canvas SQL subquery shape.
    `test/helpers/builders.dart` (createTestCollectionItem) gains an
    `overrideName` parameter.

- **ScreenScraper media gallery on game cards**

  Game cards in the collection and the bottom sheet in search show a
  horizontal carousel of ScreenScraper assets — box art, wheel, marquee,
  title screen, gameplay screenshots, fanart, composite mixes. Tap any
  thumbnail to open a fullscreen viewer with pinch-zoom, swipe between
  images, on-screen prev/next arrows, ← / → / Esc keyboard shortcuts and
  tap-on-backdrop to close. The search bottom sheet shows screenshots
  only (smaller, decision-time context); the in-collection card shows the
  full set. Mouse drag and wheel scroll are wired for Windows so the
  carousel responds the same way it does on touch and trackpad.

  Lookups are lazy: the API is called only when the user opens a card,
  and only for IGDB platforms that ScreenScraper covers (NES, SNES, Mega
  Drive, PS1/PS2, PSP, GameCube, N64, Dreamcast, Saturn, Atari, Neo Geo,
  arcade and the other retro lines — modern platforms fall through and
  the section is hidden). Responses are cached on disk for 30 days
  including negative "not found" results, so repeat opens are
  instantaneous and the rate-limited quota is preserved.

  A new section in Settings → Credentials carries the user's
  `ssid` / `sspassword`. "Check quota" calls `ssuserInfos.php` and
  displays current requests-today, daily / per-minute limits, parallel
  threads and account level. Application-level `devid` / `devpassword`
  are injected at build time via
  `--dart-define=SCREENSCRAPER_DEV_ID` and
  `--dart-define=SCREENSCRAPER_DEV_PASSWORD`. There is no fallback: if
  either the developer or user credentials are missing, the gallery is
  hidden and "Check quota" is disabled.

  * lib/core/api/screenscraper_api.dart (ScreenScraperApi,
    ScreenScraperApiException, SsMedia, SsGame, SsUserQuota,
    screenScraperApiProvider): New API client over Dio with
    `searchGame`, `getUserInfo` and `setUserCredentials`. Both API
    methods throw `ScreenScraperApiException('Missing ScreenScraper
    credentials')` when either developer or user credentials are absent.
  * lib/core/services/screenscraper_cache_service.dart
    (ScreenScraperCacheService, screenScraperCacheServiceProvider): New
    disk cache under `<documents>/ss_cache/<key>.json` with a 30-day TTL
    and negative caching for misses.
  * lib/shared/constants/screenscraper_systemes.dart
    (ScreenScraperSystemes.forIgdbPlatform, ScreenScraperSystemes.isSupported):
    New mapping from IGDB platform id to ScreenScraper `systemeid` for
    the retro platforms SS actually covers.
  * lib/features/collections/providers/screenscraper_provider.dart
    (SsLookup, screenScraperGameProvider, ScreenScraperGameNotifier):
    New `AsyncNotifierProvider.family` keyed by game name + IGDB
    platform id. Returns null cheaply when developer creds, user creds
    or platform mapping are missing, and when the disk cache holds a
    negative marker.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/screenscraper_gallery_section.dart
    (ScreenScraperGallerySection, ScreenScraperGalleryMode, _Thumbnail,
    _HorizontalScroll, _DesktopDragScrollBehavior, _FullscreenViewer,
    _NavArrow): New widget consuming the provider; renders loading,
    error, empty and data states.
  * lib/shared/widgets/media_detail_view.dart (MediaDetailView):
    New `mediaGallery` slot rendered between the comments layout and
    the activity-and-progress expansion so the gallery is always
    visible rather than hidden inside the collapsed extras section.
  * lib/features/collections/screens/item_detail_screen.dart: Pass the
    gallery widget through `mediaGallery` with the item's name and
    platform id.
  * lib/features/search/widgets/item_details_sheet.dart (ItemDetailsSheet,
    ItemDetailsSheet.game): Add `screenScraperGameName` and
    `screenScraperPlatformId` fields; the `.game(...)` factory picks
    the first SS-supported platform from the IGDB game and renders the
    screenshots-only mode below the description.
  * lib/features/settings/content/credentials_content.dart
    (_CredentialsContentState._buildScreenScraperSection,
    _CredentialsContentState._buildScreenScraperQuotaInfo,
    _CredentialsContentState._fetchScreenScraperQuota,
    _CredentialsContentState._saveScreenScraperCreds): New Credentials
    section with `ssid` and `sspassword` fields and a "Check quota"
    button that surfaces `SsUserQuota` from the API.
  * lib/features/settings/providers/settings_provider.dart
    (SettingsKeys.screenScraperSsid, SettingsKeys.screenScraperSspassword,
    SettingsState.screenScraperSsid, SettingsState.screenScraperSspassword,
    SettingsState.hasScreenScraperCreds,
    SettingsNotifier.setScreenScraperCredentials,
    SettingsNotifier._loadFromPrefs, SettingsNotifier.clearSettings):
    Persist the user credentials, push them into the API client on
    load and on every change, and wipe them with the rest on clear.
  * lib/shared/constants/api_defaults.dart (ApiDefaults.screenScraperDevId,
    ApiDefaults.screenScraperDevPassword, ApiDefaults.screenScraperSoftname,
    ApiDefaults.hasScreenScraperDevCreds): New `--dart-define`-driven
    constants for the shared developer credentials; `softname` is set to
    `tonkatsuBox`.
  * lib/shared/theme/app_assets.dart (AppAssets.iconScreenScraperColor),
    assets/images/icon_scrapper_color.png: New ScreenScraper logo used
    by the Settings section header.
  * .github/workflows/release.yml: Pass `SCREENSCRAPER_DEV_ID` and
    `SCREENSCRAPER_DEV_PASSWORD` secrets through `--dart-define` to all
    three Windows / Android APK / Android AAB build steps.

### Changed

- **Collection table view refactored into floating row cards**

  The 1375-line monolithic table widget is split into a focused module
  under `collection_table/` — one file per role (the view, the header,
  the row, the column enum, and four cell types). Visually the table
  chrome is removed: the outer surface card, the grey header strip,
  zebra striping and inter-cell borders are gone. Each row is a faint
  rounded `surfaceLight` card that floats on the page; the header sits
  above as a plain label strip. Column ordering and widths were tuned —
  name (flex 5) and tag (flex 2) are the only stretchy columns; platform
  (140), type (56), status (96), rating (60) and year (56) are fixed
  width and their content is centred. Tag moved to the trailing
  position. Rating renders an em-dash when unset. Minimum table width
  before horizontal scrolling kicks in rose from 600 to 820 so the
  title column stays readable on narrow windows.

  The table no longer holds its own vertical scroll: the body shrink-wraps
  to its content and the parent owns the scroll, so the collection hero
  scrolls together with the rows just like in grid mode. (`shrinkWrap`
  means the list isn't lazy — fine for typical collections, would need
  slivers for ten-thousand-item ones.)

  All Cyrillic dartdocs in the touched files were translated to English
  per the project comment policy.

  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_table_view.dart: Removed.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_table/collection_table_view.dart
    (CollectionTableView), table_header.dart (TableHeader), table_row.dart
    (TableRow), table_column.dart (TableColumn, kDragHandleWidth,
    kCheckboxColumnWidth, kThumbWidth, kThumbHeight, kThumbRadius),
    cells/thumbnail_cell.dart (ThumbnailCell), cells/rating_cell.dart
    (RatingCell), cells/status_cell.dart (StatusCell), cells/tag_cell.dart
    (TagCell): New module replacing the monolithic widget. Behaviour
    parity preserved: sortable / filterable columns, reorderable mode
    with drag handle, select-all tri-state checkbox, inline editing of
    status / tag / rating via popups.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_items_view.dart
    (CollectionItemsView, CollectionItemsView._withHeader, _TagGroup):
    Import re-pointed to the new module path. `_withHeader` grew a
    `wrapInScroll` flag that wraps the hero + body in a single
    `SingleChildScrollView` for table mode. Dartdocs and inline
    comments translated.
  * lib/shared/models/collection_item.dart (CollectionItem,
    CollectionItem._resolvedMedia, CollectionItem.copyWith): Dartdocs
    and inline comments translated to English; no behaviour change.
  * lib/shared/widgets/cached_image.dart (CachedImage): Dartdocs and
    inline comments translated; no behaviour change.
  * test/features/collections/widgets/collection_table_view_test.dart:
    Import re-pointed to the new module path; existing assertions
    unchanged.

### Added

- **Setting: hide empty media-type chevrons**

  New toggle in Settings → Appearance hides the chevron segments for
  media types that have zero items in the current view. Applies to the
  filter bar inside a collection and to the unified "all items"
  screen reachable from the home tab. Off by default; a currently
  selected type stays visible even if its count is zero so the user
  can still clear the filter.

  * lib/features/settings/providers/settings_provider.dart
    (SettingsKeys.hideEmptyMediaTypeChevrons, SettingsState.hideEmptyMediaTypeChevrons,
    SettingsNotifier.setHideEmptyMediaTypeChevrons): New setting plumbing
    mirroring `showRecommendations`.
  * lib/features/settings/screens/settings_screen.dart: New SettingsTile
    with a Switch under Appearance.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_filter_bar.dart
    (_CollectionFilterBarState._buildTypeChevronBar): Filter `_typeEntries`
    by count > 0 when the setting is on, keeping selected types visible.
  * lib/features/home/screens/all_items_screen.dart (_buildMediaTypeBar):
    Same filter applied to `_MediaTypeEntry` list.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb: New keys
    `settingsHideEmptyMediaTypeChevrons` and
    `settingsHideEmptyMediaTypeChevronsSubtitle`.

- **Mood Grid — visual N×M boards of items inside the Tier Lists section**

  A second board type alongside the existing ranked tier list. A grid is
  an editable N×M matrix of cells; each cell has an optional category
  label and one optional media item picked from any of the user's
  collections. The same item can appear in multiple cells. A grid is
  not bound to any collection and is not included in `.xcoll` /
  `.xcollx` exports — only in full app backups. The default preset is
  «About Me: Tonkatsu Box» (1×5 — Favorite Game / Movie / TV Show /
  Anime / Manga); a Blank option lets the user pick rows × cols.
  Tap a cell to open the item picker; right-click or long-press to
  edit the label, replace the item, or clear it. A compact stepper
  toolbar above the grid resizes rows and columns on the fly.
  Export-as-PNG renders the grid off-screen with a watermark
  matching the tier-list export style and saves via the system
  picker on every platform (SAF on Android, native dialog on
  desktop). Backups now include all mood grids and their cells.

  * lib/shared/models/mood_grid.dart (MoodGrid),
    lib/shared/models/mood_grid_cell.dart (MoodGridCell): New models
    with fromDb / toDb / fromExport / toExport / copyWith. Cells store
    `(mediaType, externalId, platformId)` directly with no FK on
    `collection_items` so the grid survives item deletion.
  * lib/core/database/schema.dart (DatabaseSchema.createMoodGridsTable,
    DatabaseSchema.createMoodGridCellsTable): New tables.
  * lib/core/database/migrations/migration_v36.dart (MigrationV36),
    lib/core/database/migrations/migration_registry.dart: Bump schema
    to v36.
  * lib/core/database/dao/mood_grid_dao.dart (MoodGridDao,
    MoodGridCellSpec): CRUD plus `resizeMoodGrid` that remaps cell
    positions to preserve (row, col) coordinates across grid resizes.
  * lib/core/database/database_service.dart (DatabaseService.moodGridDao,
    moodGridDaoProvider, DatabaseService.clearAllData): Wires the DAO
    and adds `mood_grid_cells` + `mood_grids` to the cascade clear.
  * lib/features/tier_lists/providers/mood_grids_provider.dart
    (MoodGridsNotifier, moodGridsProvider, MoodGridPreset,
    aboutMeTonkatsuBoxCells, kDefaultMoodGridTitle),
    lib/features/tier_lists/providers/mood_grid_detail_provider.dart
    (MoodGridDetailNotifier, MoodGridDetailState,
    moodGridDetailProvider): List + per-grid detail providers with
    optimistic state mutation.
  * lib/features/tier_lists/screens/mood_grid_detail_screen.dart
    (MoodGridDetailScreen): Detail screen with stepper resize bar,
    tap-to-pick cells, right-click / long-press context menu, PNG
    export, rename and delete.
  * lib/features/tier_lists/widgets/mood_grid_view.dart (MoodGridView),
    mood_grid_cell_widget.dart (MoodGridCellWidget),
    mood_grid_cell_media.dart (MoodGridCellMedia,
    resolveMoodGridCellMedia), mood_grid_export_view.dart
    (MoodGridExportView), mood_grid_item_picker.dart
    (showMoodGridItemPicker, MoodGridItemPickerResult),
    create_mood_grid_dialog.dart (CreateMoodGridDialog): Grid
    rendering, off-screen export with watermark, modal item picker
    over all collections with optional collection filter, and the
    create dialog with preset + size selector.
  * lib/features/tier_lists/screens/tier_lists_screen.dart
    (_BoardEntry, _mergeAndSort, _MoodGridCard, _showCreateMoodGridDialog):
    Lists ranked tier lists and mood grids side by side sorted by
    creation date with type badges; FAB exposes both create flows.
  * lib/core/services/backup_service.dart (BackupService, _restoreMoodGrids,
    backupFormatVersion): Backup archive now includes `mood_grids.json`
    with cells. Bumped `backupFormatVersion` to 2; restore is
    backward-compatible with v1 archives (mood-grids section is
    optional and skipped when absent).
  * lib/features/settings/content/database_content.dart: Invalidate
    `moodGridsProvider` after Reset Database.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb: Mood Grid UI strings
    (moodGridCreate, moodGridPresetAboutMe, moodGridBadge,
    moodGridAddRow, moodGridShrinkTitle, moodGridPickItem, etc.).

- **Import anime and manga lists from a public AniList username**

  New entry in Settings → Import alongside MyAnimeList / Steam / RA / Trakt.
  No OAuth required — `MediaListCollection` GraphQL endpoint returns every
  list (Watching / Completed / Planning / etc.) for any public profile in
  one call. The form takes a username, lets you toggle anime / manga,
  pick `Add new only` vs `Overwrite existing`, and target a new or
  existing collection. The username is remembered across sessions.
  AniList statuses map onto xerabora's five `ItemStatus` values:
  CURRENT / REPEATING → inProgress, COMPLETED → completed, PLANNING →
  planned, DROPPED / PAUSED → dropped. POINT_100 scores are normalised
  to the local 1..10 scale; 0 is treated as "unrated". On `COMPLETED`
  entries, episode / chapter / volume counters top up to the AniList
  totals (mirrors MAL importer semantics). `isAdult` media and AniList
  custom lists are filtered out to avoid duplicates.

  * lib/core/api/anilist_api.dart (AniListApi.fetchUserMediaList,
    AniListListEntry, AniListUserNotFoundException,
    AniListPrivateProfileException, AniListApi._parseListEntry,
    AniListApi._parseFuzzyDate): New `MediaListCollection` GraphQL
    queries (anime + manga) and DTO; HTTP 404 and GraphQL
    "not found" / "private" errors map to typed exceptions.
  * lib/core/services/anilist_import_service.dart
    (AniListImportService, AniListImportProgress, AniListImportResult,
    AniListImportStage, ImportMode, aniListImportServiceProvider): New
    service. Deduplicates against existing items by
    (collectionId, mediaType, externalId); upserts the nested `Anime`
    and `Manga` graphs in parallel before writing entries.
  * lib/features/settings/screens/anilist_import_screen.dart,
    lib/features/settings/content/anilist_import_content.dart
    (AniListImportScreen, AniListImportContent): New screen and form.
  * lib/features/settings/screens/settings_screen.dart: Adds AniList
    tile to the Import group.
  * lib/features/settings/providers/settings_provider.dart
    (SettingsKeys.aniListUsername): Persists the last-used AniList
    username after a successful import.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb: AniList import UI strings
    (settingsAniListImport, aniListImportTitle,
    aniListImportUsername, aniListImportInclude, aniListImportMode,
    aniListImportImported, aniListImportUpdated,
    aniListImportUserNotFound, aniListImportPrivateProfile, etc.).

### Changed

- **Higher-quality AniList covers in collections and search**

  AniList exposes three cover sizes (`extraLarge` ≈ 460×650,
  `large` ≈ 230×325, `medium` ≈ 100×146). The app was requesting only
  `large` / `medium` in GraphQL queries and, worse, the per-anime / manga
  `thumbUrl` used in collection grids and detail screens preferred
  `medium`, producing visibly blurry posters compared to the AniList
  website. All 10 GraphQL `coverImage` selections now include
  `extraLarge`, the models pick it with a `large` fallback, and the
  collection-item resolver prefers `coverUrl` over `coverUrlMedium`.
  Existing cached models keep their old URLs until the next upsert.

  * lib/core/api/anilist_api.dart: Adds `extraLarge` to every
    `coverImage` GraphQL selection (search, browse, by-id, by-MAL-id,
    user-list queries).
  * lib/shared/models/anime.dart (Anime.fromJson),
    lib/shared/models/manga.dart (Manga.fromJson): Prefer `extraLarge`
    with `large` fallback.
  * lib/shared/models/collection_item.dart (_resolvedMedia anime/manga
    cases): `thumbUrl` falls through `coverUrl ?? coverUrlMedium`.

- **Localization polish: capitalized Russian TMDB genres, plural search tabs, English-only code comments**

  TMDB seeds Russian genre names in lowercase (`боевик`, `комедия`); they
  now render with a capital letter wherever the genre map is consumed
  (filters, item details, resolved item rows). Search source tabs were
  using singular labels (`Фильм`, `Игра`, `Сериал`, `Анимация`) shared
  with detail screens — they now use dedicated plural keys
  (`Фильмы`, `Игры`, `Сериалы`, `Анимация`), with English equivalents
  (`Movies`, `Games`, `TV Shows`, `Animation`) staying the same shape.
  In parallel, code comments across the largest lib files and every
  test file with Cyrillic comments were translated to English (or
  removed where they only restated the symbol name); the `finish` skill
  now codifies the rule so future diffs stay clean.

  * lib/core/database/dao/movie_dao.dart (MovieDao.getTmdbGenreMap,
    MovieDao._capitalize): Capitalize first letter on read so downstream
    consumers (filter chips, ID→name resolution in `CollectionDao`) all
    see Title Case.
  * lib/l10n/app_ru.arb, lib/l10n/app_en.arb (searchSourceGames,
    searchSourceMovies, searchSourceTvShows, searchSourceAnimation): New
    plural labels for search source tabs.
  * lib/features/search/sources/igdb_games_source.dart,
    tmdb_movies_source.dart, tmdb_tv_source.dart, tmdb_anime_source.dart
    (label): Switched from singular `mediaType*` to plural
    `searchSource*` keys.
  * .claude/skills/finish/SKILL.md: New "Comment style" section
    enforcing English-only, WHY-only, ≤1-line comments project-wide.

### Added

- **Bulk actions across collections and All Items**

  Selection now works everywhere items are shown: the collection table
  view gets a checkbox column (header has a tristate select-all for the
  currently visible rows), the collection grid / list / manual-reorder
  views and the All Items home grid get a Google-Photos-style checkmark
  overlay in the top-left corner of each card (subtle on hover, brand-
  filled when selected, with a brand-tinted border around the card).
  While at least one item is selected, tapping any other card toggles
  selection instead of opening the detail screen. On every screen,
  selecting one or more items reveals the same bulk action bar with:
  move to another collection, copy to another collection, change status
  (status popup), and remove. Inside a single collection, when sort is
  manual, the bar also shows move-to-top / move-to-bottom. All bulk
  operations live in a single helper (`BulkOperations`) so they can be
  invoked from any screen — they call the existing single-item
  repository methods in a loop, accumulate affected collections / media
  types / tier lists, and run the provider invalidation **once** at the
  end. N items no longer trigger N redundant reloads. Status update
  path uses `AllItemsNotifier`'s existing `updateStatusLocally` so the
  home grid does not have to refetch; each affected collection notifier
  is invalidated once.

  * lib/features/collections/helpers/bulk_operations.dart (BulkOperations,
    BulkOperations.removeItems, BulkOperations.moveItemsToCollection,
    BulkOperations.cloneItemsToCollection, BulkOperations.updateItemsStatus,
    BulkOperations._invalidateAfterMutation, BulkOperations._resolveTargetTagId):
    New. Collection-agnostic helper — takes `List<CollectionItem>`
    (each item carries its own `collectionId` and `mediaType`) and a
    `WidgetRef`; correctly invalidates the union of affected source
    collections plus the target.
  * lib/features/collections/providers/collection_selection_provider.dart
    (CollectionSelectionNotifier, collectionSelectionProvider): New.
    Per-collection `Set<int>` of selected ids (toggle / selectAll /
    clear / removeIds), family-keyed by `int?`.
  * lib/features/collections/providers/all_items_selection_provider.dart
    (AllItemsSelectionNotifier, allItemsSelectionProvider): New.
    Global selection for the All Items home screen.
  * lib/features/collections/providers/collections_provider.dart
    (CollectionItemsNotifier.moveItemsToTop, CollectionItemsNotifier.moveItemsToBottom,
    CollectionItemsNotifier._moveItemsToEdge): New methods that stay on
    the notifier because they need single-collection `sort_order`
    context. They preserve the relative order of the selected group.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/bulk_action_bar.dart (BulkActionBar):
    New. Reads its `List<CollectionItem>` and an `onClearSelection`
    callback from the parent — fully selection-provider-agnostic.
    Move-to-top / move-to-bottom only render when a `collectionId`
    is supplied and that collection is in manual sort.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/selectable_poster_card.dart
    (SelectablePosterCard, _CheckCircle): New. Overlay wrapper that
    adds the corner check-circle and brand border for grid views.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_table_view.dart
    (CollectionTableView, _TableHeader, _TableRow): Add `selectedIds`,
    `onToggleSelect`, `onToggleSelectAll` parameters. New checkbox
    column in the header (tristate select-all) and in each row.
    Selected rows get a brand-tinted background.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_items_view.dart
    (CollectionItemsView.build, CollectionItemsView._buildListTile,
    CollectionItemsView._buildPosterCard, CollectionItemsView._buildReorderableList):
    Wire all four item views (table, grid, list, reorderable) to
    `collectionSelectionProvider`. Grid / list / reorderable wrap each
    poster or tile in `SelectablePosterCard`; when a selection is
    active, tapping a card toggles selection instead of opening the
    detail screen.
  * lib/features/collections/screens/collection_screen.dart: Mount
    `BulkActionBar` between the title bar and the item list whenever
    the user can edit and the selection is non-empty (any view mode).
    Passes the selected items list + `onClearSelection` callback.
  * lib/features/home/screens/all_items_screen.dart
    (_AllItemsScreenState.build, _AllItemsScreenState._buildGridView):
    Wrap each `MediaPosterCard` in `SelectablePosterCard`; while a
    selection is active, tapping a card toggles selection instead of
    opening detail. Mount `BulkActionBar` above the grid when the
    selection is non-empty.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb (bulkSelected,
    bulkClearSelection, bulkMove, bulkCopy, bulkChangeStatus,
    bulkRemoveConfirm, bulkResult, bulkRemoved, bulkStatusUpdated): New.
  * test/features/collections/providers/collection_selection_provider_test.dart:
    New. 6 cases covering toggle, selectAll, clear, removeIds, and
    family isolation between collections.

- **Move-to-top / move-to-bottom for collection items in manual sort**

  When the collection is sorted manually (Custom order), the row context
  menu (right-click on desktop, long-press on mobile) now includes two new
  entries — «В начало списка» and «В конец списка» — that jump the item to
  the first or last position in one click instead of dragging through the
  whole list. The entries are hidden in other sort modes, where they would
  have no visible effect.

  * lib/features/collections/providers/collections_provider.dart
    (CollectionItemsNotifier.moveItemToTop, CollectionItemsNotifier.moveItemToBottom):
    New. Locate the item by id, no-op when already at the edge or missing,
    delegate to `reorderItem` so the existing sort_order renumbering and
    persistence path is reused.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_items_view.dart
    (CollectionItemsView._showItemContextMenu): Read `collectionSortProvider`
    inside the menu builder; prepend two `PopupMenuItem` entries plus a
    divider when `sortMode == manual && canEdit`; wire the new `moveToTop`
    / `moveToBottom` switch cases to the notifier.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb (moveToTop, moveToBottom): New.
  * test/features/collections/providers/collections_provider_move_test.dart:
    New. 8 cases covering move-to-top and move-to-bottom for first/middle/
    last items, no-op at edges, and no-op for unknown id.

- **Import anime and manga lists from MyAnimeList XML export**

  New Settings → Import → MyAnimeList screen accepts the official XML export (`myanimelist.net/panel.php?go=export`), batch-resolves MAL IDs to AniList via `idMal_in` (50 per request, ~75 s for a 5k-entry library), and writes results into a target collection. AniList becomes the canonical record; the MAL link is preserved as a markdown footer in `user_comment`. Status mapping: Watching/Reading → in-progress, Completed → completed, On-Hold and Plan to Watch/Read → planned, Dropped → dropped. When a `Completed` entry has missing watched-episode counts or dates, the importer back-fills them from the AniList totals and from `my_start_date` / `my_finish_date`. Re-import deduplicates on `(collection_id, media_type, external_id)` and merges instead of duplicating: status uses `mergeExternalStatus` (won't downgrade `completed`, won't touch `dropped`), progress is `max(local, mal)`, started/completed dates take the earliest start and latest finish, `user_comment` is rebuilt from the latest MAL data. Titles missing on AniList go to the wishlist with a note containing the MAL link, status, score, tags, and comments — re-import updates the existing wishlist row instead of duplicating it.

  * lib/core/services/mal_import_service.dart (MalImportService, MalEntry, MalParsedFile, MalImportProgress, MalImportResult, MalImportStage, MalFileKind, MalImportResultToUniversal): New. XML parser, MAL→AniList resolver, dedup-aware writer with wishlist fallback.
  * lib/core/api/anilist_api.dart (AniListApi.getAnimeByMalIds, AniListApi.getMangaByMalIds): New batch lookups via `idMal_in` GraphQL filter; returns `Map<int malId, Anime|Manga>` so callers can correlate exports.
  * lib/features/settings/screens/mal_import_screen.dart (MalImportScreen), lib/features/settings/content/mal_import_content.dart (MalImportContent): New. Picks up to two XML files (auto-detects anime vs manga via `<user_export_type>`), routes to either a new collection or an existing one, and shows three-stage progress (resolving anime / resolving manga / matching entries) before navigating to `ImportResultScreen`.
  * lib/features/settings/screens/settings_screen.dart: Add MyAnimeList tile to the Import section.
  * lib/shared/theme/app_assets.dart (AppAssets.iconMalColor): New, points to `assets/images/MyAnimeList_Logo.png`.
  * assets/images/MyAnimeList_Logo.png: New brand asset.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb: Add `settingsMalImport` plus 21 `malImport*` keys.
  * pubspec.yaml: Add direct `xml: ^6.5.0` dependency.
  * test/core/services/mal_import_service_test.dart: 18 tests covering XML parsing (anime/manga, status mapping, validation, kind fallback), `Completed` back-fill, unmatched-to-wishlist with MAL markdown link, and re-import dedup that updates instead of inserting.

- **Content language picker in welcome wizard with UI-language autosync**

  The wizard language step now lets the user pick the TMDB content
  language (used for movie / TV descriptions) directly, instead of
  silently keeping the previous `ru-RU` default while the UI is set
  to English. Tapping a UI-language option also auto-applies the
  matching content language (English → `en-US`, Russian → `ru-RU`)
  until the user picks a content language by hand — after that the
  manual choice sticks and toggling the UI language stops touching
  it. The same picker now drives the Settings → Content language
  dialog, so adding a new locale flows through both surfaces from a
  single source.

  * lib/shared/constants/tmdb_content_languages.dart (TmdbContentLanguage,
    kTmdbContentLanguages, defaultContentLanguageForUi): New. Single
    extensible list of supported TMDB locales plus the UI → content
    fallback map; new pairs (UI locale + matching `xx-YY` translation)
    are added here in one place.
  * lib/features/welcome/widgets/welcome_step_language.dart
    (WelcomeStepLanguage, _WelcomeStepLanguageState._onUiLanguageSelected,
    _WelcomeStepLanguageState._onContentLanguageSelected,
    _ContentLanguageDropdown): Convert to `ConsumerStatefulWidget`;
    add a styled dropdown bound to `tmdbLanguage`; track a
    `_contentLangTouched` flag so UI-language taps only seed the
    content language while the user hasn't customized it.
  * lib/features/settings/screens/settings_screen.dart
    (_SettingsScreenState._contentLanguageLabel,
    _SettingsScreenState._showContentLanguagePicker): Drop the two
    hardcoded `en-US` / `ru-RU` branches; iterate `kTmdbContentLanguages`
    for both the tile value and the picker dialog.
  * test/shared/constants/tmdb_content_languages_test.dart: New. Verifies
    list non-emptiness, code uniqueness, IETF BCP 47 code format, and
    `defaultContentLanguageForUi` mapping (including unknown-code
    fallback to `en-US`).
  * test/features/welcome/widgets/welcome_step_language_test.dart: Add
    tests for dropdown presence, content-language save, UI → content
    autosync for both `en` and `ru`, and that a manual dropdown pick
    disables the autosync on subsequent UI-language taps.

### Changed

- **Unified brand-icon rendering across settings, welcome wizard, and search**

  Settings API-keys screen now uses a wizard-style section header (logo + description, e.g. "Game search (IGDB)") instead of a text-only badge. Integration and Import tiles show the full-colour brand logo (GitHub, Trakt, Steam, RetroAchievements, Kodi, Discord) on a neutral plate, matching the welcome-wizard step. Search source dropdown and filter bar render the same brand PNGs in place of generic Material icons. Monochrome glyphs (simpleicons) stay for header badges that need `ColorFilter` tinting for active/inactive state.

  * assets/images/icon_anilist_color.png, icon_discord_color.png, icon_github.png, icon_igdb_color.png, icon_kodi_color.png, icon_steam_color.png, icon_steamgriddb_color.png, icon_tmdb_color.png, icon_trakt_color.png, icon_vndb_color.png: New. Normalised 128×128 PNGs (dashboardicons + official brand kits), trimmed alpha, 10% uniform margin. IGDB mark whitened for visibility on dark plates.
  * assets/images/ra_logo.png: Re-normalised to match.
  * assets/images/icon_kodi.svg: Replaced the dashboardicons variant with a simpleicons mono SVG to drop the embedded `<style>` block that `flutter_svg` flags as "unhandled element".
  * assets/images/icon_ra.svg, icon_steam.svg, icon_trakt.svg: Removed (no longer referenced).
  * lib/shared/theme/app_assets.dart (AppAssets): Add `iconDiscordColor`, `iconKodiColor`, `iconSteamColor`, `iconTraktColor`, `iconRaColor`, `iconGithub`, `iconTmdbColor`, `iconIgdbColor`, `iconSteamGridDbColor`, `iconAnilistColor`, `iconVndbColor`; drop unused mono `iconSteam`, `iconTrakt`, `iconRa`.
  * lib/shared/models/data_source.dart (DataSource.iconAsset): New field — brand PNG path per source.
  * lib/shared/widgets/source_badge.dart (SourceBadge): Render brand logo left of the label when `source.iconAsset` is set.
  * lib/features/settings/widgets/settings_tile.dart (_LeadingBubble): Route `.png` assets through `Image.asset`, `.svg` through `SvgPicture.asset`; bump asset scale multiplier to 1.8× for visual parity with Material icons.
  * lib/features/settings/screens/settings_screen.dart: GitHub / Trakt / Steam / RA import tiles, Kodi integration tile, and Discord Rich Presence tile switch to colored PNGs. Author-name bubble now tracks compact-screen sizing like `SettingsTile`.
  * lib/features/settings/content/credentials_content.dart (_CredentialsContentState._buildSourceHeader): New wizard-style header (`[logo] description (BrandName)`) replaces per-section `SourceBadge` row for IGDB / SteamGridDB / TMDB.
  * lib/features/welcome/widgets/welcome_step_api_keys.dart (_ApiSection, _BuiltInKeySection): Accept optional `iconAsset`; render brand PNG with tooltip instead of a text tag chip.
  * lib/features/search/models/search_source.dart (SearchSource.iconAsset): New virtual getter, defaults to `null`.
  * lib/features/search/sources/igdb_games_source.dart, tmdb_movies_source.dart, tmdb_tv_source.dart, tmdb_anime_source.dart, anilist_anime_source.dart, anilist_manga_source.dart, vndb_source.dart: Override `iconAsset` with the corresponding brand PNG.
  * lib/features/search/sources/search_sources.dart (SourceGroupEntry): Add `groupIconAsset` field; populate from the first source of each group.
  * lib/features/search/widgets/source_dropdown.dart (SourceDropdown, _sourceGlyph): Render brand PNG (22 px for current source, 20 px for group headers) when asset is set.
  * lib/features/search/widgets/filter_bar.dart: Render group brand PNG (20 px) in the filter-bar popup.

### Fixed

- **RetroAchievements sync now respects manual RA↔IGDB links and reports wishlist count honestly**

  Previously, when a game went to the wishlist because IGDB couldn't match it by name, manually adding the game and linking it to RA via the achievement card had no effect on subsequent syncs — the same game was offered to the wishlist again every run, because the importer only matched via `IgdbApi.multiSearchGamesByName` and never read the `tracker_game_data` table it was already writing to. Now the importer pre-fetches all RA→IGDB rows from `tracker_game_data` before searching IGDB and reuses the cached `Game` instead of doing a name-based lookup; broken links (cached `Game` missing) fall back to the existing IGDB search path. The result struct also separates `unmatched` (no IGDB match and no manual link) from `wishlisted` (rows actually inserted this run), so when `addToWishlist` is off or the wishlist row already existed, the result screen no longer claims new wishlist additions. Progress UI now splits the IGDB lookup phase (`searchingGames`) from the collection-write phase (`matchingGames`) instead of running both under the same stage.

  * lib/core/services/ra_import_service.dart (RaImportService.importFromProfile, RaImportService._resolveIgdbGame, RaImportService._addToWishlistIfNotExists, RaImportStage, RaImportResult, RaImportResultToUniversal): Pre-fetch `tracker_game_data` for `TrackerType.ra`, build `raIdToIgdbId` map, split `games` into linked/unlinked, only batch-search the unlinked subset. New `_resolveIgdbGame` helper picks the cached `Game` for linked entries and falls back to a single IGDB search when the local cache misses. `_addToWishlistIfNotExists` now returns `bool` so the caller increments `wishlisted` only when a new row was actually inserted. `RaImportResult` gains a `wishlisted` field; `toUniversal()` reads `wishlistedByType` from `wishlisted` instead of `unmatched`. New `RaImportStage.searchingGames` covers IGDB lookup; `matchingGames` is reserved for the collection writes. `_trackerDao` is now required (was nullable) — needed for the link lookup to work outside tests.
  * lib/features/settings/content/ra_import_content.dart (_RaImportContentState._buildProgressSection): Render the new `searchingGames` stage with `l.raImportSearchingIgdb`.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, lib/l10n/app_ru.arb (raImportSearchingIgdb): New string for the IGDB-search progress stage.
  * test/core/services/ra_import_service_test.dart: New cases — manual link skips IGDB and reuses cached game; broken manual link falls back to IGDB search; `wishlisted=0` when `addToWishlist=false`; `wishlisted=0` when the wishlist row already existed; `RaImportResult.wishlisted` constructor + `toUniversal` mapping. Existing progress test updated to assert `searchingGames` and `matchingGames` both fire.

### Fixed

- **Tracker progress is now scoped per platform, not per IGDB game**

  External tracker data (RetroAchievements progress, achievements, award
  state, last-played timestamps) was keyed by IGDB game id alone, so a
  single multi-platform game in the collection could only ever hold one
  set of stats — syncing a second platform install silently overwrote
  the first one and its history was lost. Each platform install now
  owns its own tracker row: the unique index gains
  `COALESCE(platform_id, -1)`, the model carries `platformId`, and the
  UI scopes its lookups by the current `CollectionItem.platformId`.
  Refreshing one install's status / dates no longer touches sibling
  installs of the same IGDB game. On migration the legacy
  `platform_id = NULL` rows are backfilled from the user's
  `collection_items` when exactly one platform install of that game
  exists; ambiguous rows are dropped so stale data can't leak across
  platforms. Backups and `.xcoll` / `.xcollx` exports/imports round-trip
  the new column automatically; archives produced by older versions are
  tolerated (the fallback lookup still picks up NULL rows restored from
  legacy backups).

  * lib/core/database/schema.dart (DatabaseSchema.createTrackerGameDataTable):
    Add `platform_id INTEGER` column; replace the
    `idx_tracker_game_data_unique` index with one that includes
    `COALESCE(platform_id, -1)` so distinct platforms keep distinct rows.
  * lib/core/database/migrations/migration_v37.dart (MigrationV37),
    lib/core/database/migrations/migration_registry.dart: New v37
    migration that adds the column and rebuilds the unique index in place.
  * lib/core/database/migrations/migration_v38.dart (MigrationV38):
    Backfills `platform_id` on legacy tracker rows by joining each NULL
    row against `collection_items`: unambiguous matches (exactly one
    platform in the user's collection for that IGDB game) get filled in,
    everything else is dropped together with its orphaned achievements
    so the legacy fallback can't leak data across platform installs.
  * lib/core/database/database_service.dart: Bump schema version to 38.
    `getItemIdsByExternalId` gains `platformId` + `filterByPlatform` and
    returns `platform_id` alongside id/collectionId so the sync code can
    address one platform install at a time.
  * lib/shared/models/tracker_game_data.dart (TrackerGameData,
    TrackerGameData.fromDb, TrackerGameData.toDb, TrackerGameData.copyWith):
    New `platformId` field threaded through fromDb / toDb / copyWith.
    `copyWith` adds a `clearPlatformId` sentinel for explicit null-set.
    All dartdocs translated to English.
  * lib/core/database/dao/tracker_dao.dart (TrackerDao.getGameData,
    TrackerDao.getGameDataForAnyPlatform, TrackerDao.deleteGameData):
    `getGameData` accepts optional `platformId`. New
    `getGameDataForAnyPlatform` returns every platform variant for a
    given IGDB game. `deleteGameData` accepts `platformId` /
    `allPlatforms` so per-platform unlink is possible; achievements for
    a `tracker_game_id` are dropped only when no other tracker row still
    references them.
  * lib/features/collections/providers/tracker_provider.dart (TrackerKey,
    TrackerDetailNotifier): Provider family key switched from `int` to a
    `({int gameId, int? platformId})` record. The notifier reads the
    per-platform row first and falls back to the legacy
    platform-agnostic row when none exists. `unlinkRaGame` deletes only
    the current platform's row; `_syncToCollectionItems` filters
    `CollectionItem`s by `platformId` so PS2 progress doesn't bleed into
    a GameCube row.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/ra_achievements_section.dart
    (RaAchievementsSection): New `platformId` widget property; every
    `trackerDetailProvider(...)` call now uses the composite key.
  * lib/features/collections/screens/item_detail_screen.dart: Pass
    `(gameId: item.externalId, platformId: item.platformId)` everywhere
    the tracker provider is read or watched, and forward `platformId`
    to `RaAchievementsSection`.
  * lib/core/services/tracker_sync_service.dart
    (TrackerSyncService.fullSyncRa, ra_to_igdb_mapper import): Bulk RA
    sync derives the IGDB platform id from `raGame.consoleId` via
    `RaToIgdbMapper.primaryIgdbPlatformId` and writes it onto the
    upserted `TrackerGameData`.
  * lib/core/services/ra_import_service.dart
    (RaImportService.importFromProfile,
    RaImportService._saveTrackerGameData): Same platform derivation
    applied to the import flow; the in-collection duplicate check now
    passes the derived `platformId` to `findCollectionItem` so a second
    platform install of the same IGDB title creates a fresh row instead
    of overwriting the first one.
  * test/shared/models/tracker_game_data_test.dart (TrackerGameData),
    test/core/database/dao/tracker_dao_test.dart (TrackerDao): New —
    14 tests covering fromDb/toDb round-trip (with platformId, NULL,
    missing key), copyWith semantics, per-platform upsert isolation,
    NULL bucket behaviour, and the new delete variants including the
    achievements-cleanup branch.

## [0.28.0] - 2026-04-23

### Added

- **Personalized collections with cover image, description, and rich hero banner**

  Opt-in "Rich collection view" toggle in Settings gives each collection a hero section with cover image, title, and description on the home grid and the collection screen. Cover is chosen via a new Edit dialog; files live in `<appSupport>/collections/` and travel inside `.xcollx` as a separate section (not in JSON), preserving export-format compatibility. Collections without a custom cover fall back deterministically to one of 3 bundled default banners (`id % 3`). 11 localization keys EN+RU.

  * lib/core/database/migrations/migration_v35.dart: New. Adds `hero_image_path` column to `collections`.
  * lib/core/services/collection_hero_service.dart (CollectionHeroService): New. Stores hero images as `hero_<id>_<ts>.<ext>` under `<appSupport>`.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_hero_background.dart (CollectionHeroBackground), rich_hero_banner.dart (RichHeroBanner), classic_collection_card.dart, rich_collection_card.dart, collection_card_shell.dart, collection_card_overlay.dart: New. Shared shell (focus / hover / border) and text overlay across both card variants; `CollectionHeroBackground` exposes `soft` / `standard` gradient presets with DPR-aware cache width.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/edit_collection_dialog.dart (EditCollectionDialog): New. Name + description + image picker with live preview and "Remove image" action.
  * lib/features/collections/providers/rich_collections_enabled_provider.dart (richCollectionsEnabledProvider): New.
  * lib/features/collections/screens/collection_screen.dart: Hero banner is a sliver that scrolls with the grid rather than a pinned header.
  * lib/core/services/export_service.dart, import_service.dart: Carry hero binary as a separate `.xcollx` section.

- **Right-click context menu on the Collections screen**

  Right-click on empty space (between or below cards) opens a popup with the primary FAB actions: Create new collection, Import collection, Toggle grid/list view. The card-level right-click menu (Open / Rename / Delete) keeps priority on cards via the gesture arena.

  * lib/features/collections/screens/home_screen.dart: Add empty-space right-click handler.

- **Right-click context menu on All Items**

  Right-click on a poster opens Move to collection / Copy to collection / Remove, mirroring the menu inside a collection. The editability check is shared between the context menu and the item detail sheet.

  * lib/features/collections/screens/all_items_screen.dart (_isItemEditable): Extract shared predicate; delegate menu actions to `CollectionActions` for identical dialogs, snackbars, and invalidation.

- **Inline status switcher in item context menus**

  Both the collection's right-click menu and the All Items right-click menu grow a bottom row showing all five statuses as a horizontal "piano" of coloured segments. One tap updates the status without leaving the menu. Labels adapt to media type (Playing for games / Watching for movies & TV). Status change patches the list locally so the All Items grid no longer flashes through `AsyncLoading` on every tap.

  * lib/features/collections/widgets/status_chip_row.dart (StatusChipRow, statusChipPopupMenuEntries, tryDecodeStatusMenuValue): Expose `height` parameter; add helpers for menu-entry + value decoding reused by both call sites.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_items_view.dart, lib/features/collections/screens/all_items_screen.dart: Wire the status row into both context menus.
  * lib/shared/models/collection_item.dart (CollectionItem.withStatus): New.
  * lib/features/collections/providers/all_items_provider.dart (AllItemsNotifier.updateStatusLocally): New. Local patch avoids a full reload.

- **"Remember credentials" checkbox on Steam Import**

  Opt-in toggle under the API key / Steam ID fields persists both values (plus the flag itself) in `SharedPreferences` and prefills them on reopen. Unchecking clears the saved pair so stale data isn't left behind. Prefs writes are `unawaited` so they don't delay the import start.

  * lib/features/imports/widgets/steam_import_content.dart: Add remember-me toggle + prefill logic.
  * lib/features/settings/providers/settings_provider.dart: Persistence keys.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, app_ru.arb: Toggle label + help text.

- **Search now matches user notes and author review**

  In-collection search bar and the All Items global search compare against `CollectionItem.userComment` and `CollectionItem.authorComment`, in addition to `itemName` and tag names. Case-insensitive.

  * lib/features/collections/screens/collection_screen.dart, all_items_screen.dart: Extend search predicate.

- **TMDB search filters expanded**

  Movies / TV / Anime tabs gain four new / upgraded filters on top of the existing genre + year: multi-select genre (OR match), Min rating (Any / 6+ / 7+ / 8+ / 9+ on the 1–10 scale, sent as `vote_average.gte`), Min votes (Any / 100 / 500 / 1000 / 5000, sent as `vote_count.gte`; previously hardcoded to the "Top rated" sort and not user-adjustable), Original language (10 languages, sent as `with_original_language`). Paired with Min rating, Min votes filters out "10/10 with one vote" noise. 13 localization keys EN+RU.

  * lib/core/api/tmdb_api.dart (TmdbApi.discoverMovies, TmdbApi.discoverTvShows): Accept new `voteAverageGte`, `voteCountGte`, `originalLanguage` params.
  * lib/features/search/filters/tmdb_genre_filter.dart (TmdbGenreFilter): Enable multi-select.
  * lib/features/search/filters/min_rating_filter.dart (MinRatingFilter), min_votes_filter.dart (MinVotesFilter), tmdb_language_filter.dart (TmdbLanguageFilter): New.
  * lib/features/search/sources/tmdb_movies_source.dart, tmdb_tv_source.dart, tmdb_anime_source.dart: Wire new filters; client-side genre fallback on text search supports multi-genre.

- **AniList search filters expanded**

  Anime tab goes from 2 filters (genre, status) to 4: multi-select genre (`genre_in: [String]`), anime format (`MediaFormat`), and year via `startDate` bounds — reliable across all anime, including older and cancelled titles where `seasonYear` is null. Manga tab goes from 2 to 4: multi-select genre, status (`MediaStatus`, with manga-specific labels), and year range via the same bounds. `MangaFormatFilter` is limited to AniList-valid values; MANHWA / MANHUA / LIGHT_NOVEL are not members of AniList's `MediaFormat` enum and were removed.

  * lib/core/api/anilist_api.dart (AniListApi.browseAnime, AniListApi.browseManga): Change `$genre: String` → `$genres: [String]`; add `$format`, `$status`, `$startDateGreater`, `$startDateLesser` GraphQL vars.
  * lib/features/search/filters/anilist_anime_format_filter.dart (AniListAnimeFormatFilter), anilist_manga_status_filter.dart (AniListMangaStatusFilter): New.
  * lib/features/search/filters/manga_format_filter.dart (MangaFormatFilter.options): Limit to MANGA, NOVEL, ONE_SHOT.
  * lib/features/search/filters/anilist_anime_genre_filter.dart, anilist_genre_filter.dart: Enable multi-select.
  * lib/features/search/sources/anilist_anime_source.dart, anilist_manga_source.dart: Wire new filters.

- **IGDB search filters expanded**

  Games tab goes from 3 filters (genre, platform, year) to 5: multi-select genre (IGDB syntax `genres = (12,31)` for OR match; previously single `genres = (12)`), Min rating (6+ / 7+ / 8+ / 9+ on the 1–10 scale, converted ×10 before hitting IGDB's native 0–100 `rating >= N`), Game mode (Single player / Multiplayer / Co-operative / Split screen / MMO / Battle Royale; canonical IGDB IDs 1-6; sent as `game_modes = (1,3)`).

  * lib/core/api/igdb_api.dart (IgdbApi.searchGames, IgdbApi.browseGames): Accept `List<int>? genreIds / gameModeIds` and `int? minRating`.
  * lib/features/search/filters/igdb_min_rating_filter.dart (IgdbMinRatingFilter), igdb_game_mode_filter.dart (IgdbGameModeFilter): New.
  * lib/features/search/filters/igdb_genre_filter.dart (IgdbGenreFilter): Enable multi-select.
  * lib/features/search/sources/igdb_games_source.dart: Wire new filters; convert Min rating UI value ×10 before the API call.

- **Year filter extended and more granular**

  Shared `YearFilter` used by TMDB / AniList / IGDB now lists individual years from the current year down to 1980 (was: down to 2000), with decade buckets for 1970s and 1960s for truly retro (Atari era). Popover is `searchable` since the list is long. Previously users had no way to pick e.g. 1995 directly — had to fall back to the "1990s" bucket. New localization keys EN+RU cover anime formats, manga statuses, and game modes.

  * lib/features/search/filters/year_filter.dart (YearFilter.options, YearFilter.searchable): Extend range to 1980; enable searchable popover.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, app_ru.arb: Add labels for new filter values.

### Changed

- **Prune visual-overfit asserts across the test suite**

  The suite had ~1000 assertions that pinned tests to specific colours, icon constants, font sizes, paddings, and structural wrapper widgets (Container / SizedBox / Padding). Every one of those would have broken on a cosmetic redesign without a real behavioural change. Kept what verifies behaviour — data flowing to UI, callbacks firing, conditional show / hide on state change, prop pass-through, collaborator calls; dropped what only pinned visuals. ~190 tests removed or collapsed; 4617 tests still green.

  * test/shared/theme/app_colors_test.dart, app_typography_test.dart, app_theme_test.dart: Delete. Every assertion compared a theme token to its own hard-coded value.
  * test/shared/widgets/media_poster_card_test.dart, shimmer_loading_test.dart, star_rating_bar_test.dart, dual_rating_badge_test.dart, screen_app_bar_test.dart: Rewrite around behaviour. Drop icon sizes, elevation / clipBehavior / border width + colour, ColoredBox alpha overlays, hard-coded child-count structural probes.
  * test/shared/extensions/snackbar_extension_test.dart: Keep type → matching icon contract, loading replaces icon with CircularProgressIndicator, action / duration / hideSnack semantics. Drop icon / message / border colour probes, fontSize 13, SnackBar elevation 4, behavior / dismissDirection.
  * test/shared/models/item_status_test.dart: Keep enum contract, value / fromString + fallbacks, sortPriority ordering / uniqueness, and the "every status has a unique icon" invariant. Drop the specific `AppColors.X` / `Icons.X` mappings.
  * test/features/welcome/widgets/welcome_step_intro_test.dart, welcome_step_how_it_works_test.dart, step_indicator_test.dart: Collapse to smoke tests + behavioural toggles (pending / active / done swaps number ↔ checkmark, onTap fires). Drop colour / size / static-label probes on content pages.
  * test/features/collections/widgets/vgmaps_panel_test.dart, steamgriddb_panel_test.dart, canvas_image_item_test.dart, canvas_text_item_test.dart: Drop chrome-visibility asserts (close / arrow_back / arrow_forward / home / refresh / search / image_search / map) and layout probes (SizedBox.expand width / height, Card clipBehavior antiAlias, Padding 8, "text has no Container background"). Behavioural coverage retained: canGoBack / canGoForward disable state, error-state conditional icon, captured-image bar flow with Add-to-Board callback.
  * test/features/search/widgets/discover_row_test.dart, test/features/tier_lists/widgets/tier_row_test.dart: Replace SizedBox / TierItemCard structural probes with positive absence checks.

- **Tags are preserved when moving or copying an item between collections**

  Right-click Move / Copy remap the item's tag to the target collection by name (case-insensitive, Unicode-safe via Dart `toLowerCase`, so «РПГ» matches «рпг»). If a tag with the same name already exists, the item is linked to it; otherwise a new tag is created with the source tag's colour. Previously tags were silently dropped on move, and Clone copied a stale `tag_id` referencing a tag from a different collection. Moves to uncategorised still clear the tag.

  * lib/data/daos/tag_dao.dart (TagDao.findTagByNameCaseInsensitive, TagDao.resolveOrCreateInCollection): New.
  * lib/data/daos/collection_dao.dart (CollectionDao.cloneItemToCollection): Null `tag_id` in the copied row.
  * lib/features/collections/providers/collections_provider.dart (CollectionItemsNotifier.moveItem, CollectionItemsNotifier.cloneItem): Accept optional `sourceTagId`; resolve and write the target tag once (no clear-then-set round-trip); invalidate `collectionTagsProvider` when a new tag was created.
  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_actions.dart: Pass `sourceTagId` from the source item.

- **Tap anywhere on the review / notes block to edit**

  Author review and personal notes sections on the item detail screen enter editing mode on a single tap, whether empty or populated. Markdown links inside the rendered text keep working because their `TapGestureRecognizer` wins the gesture arena over the ancestor `InkWell`. Author review stays non-interactive for read-only collections. Trade-off: drag-selection of rendered text is no longer available — users copy from the TextField after entering edit mode.

  * lib/shared/widgets/media_detail_view.dart: Wrap review / notes in `InkWell`; gate author review edit on `canEdit`.

- **Vague UI terms renamed per user feedback**

  «Список» (Wishlist nav tab) → «Желаемое» in Russian. «Профили» / «Профиль» in Settings → «Профили приложения» / «Автор коллекций» (EN: "App profiles" / "Collection author"), resolving the ambiguity between multi-user profiles and the collection author name. «элемент» → «тайтл» across 27 strings (including plural forms): FAB labels, stats, snackbars, tier lists, tags, imports, wishlist, all-items. "Element" is retained on the canvas where it refers to board primitives (text / sticker / link), not collection items.

  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, app_ru.arb: Rename keys / update values.

- **Kodi settings screen fully localized**

  ~45 new localization keys cover Connection (Host / Port / Username / Password / Test connection), Sync (Target collection, Enable sync, Sync interval, Sub-collections, Import ratings), Debug (Sync status, Last sync, Clear timestamp, Request log, Raw JSON-RPC). The "Integrations" section header and "Kodi" subtitle on the main Settings screen are also localized. Proper nouns (the word "Kodi", JSON-RPC API examples like `VideoLibrary.GetMovies`) remain in English.

  * lib/features/settings/screens/kodi_screen.dart, settings_screen.dart: Route hardcoded strings through `S.of(context)`.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, app_ru.arb: Add keys.

- **Empty-collection hint localized**

  Two fallback hints below the "No items yet" header (`collectionEmptyAddHint`, `collectionEmptyReadonly`) were still hardcoded English; now translated to Russian.

  * lib/features/collections/widgets/collection_items_view.dart: Replace hardcoded strings with `S.of(context)` lookups.

- **Settings screen reorganized per user feedback**

  Section order is now Profile → Data (Backup / Restore / Import / Storage) → Appearance → Services → About. Data-critical flows (backup, import) surface right after the profile block. The Gamepad Debug entry is removed from the main list (still reachable through the Debug Hub in `kDebugMode` builds). The Error group no longer renders as a separate section. Version is a tile inside About. Discord RPC and Discord RA sync move out of Appearance into Services — they're integrations, not look-and-feel toggles.

  * lib/features/settings/screens/settings_screen.dart: Reorder sections; remove orphan entries.

- **Colored iOS-style leading bubbles on every settings tile**

  Each row gets a 28×28 rounded coloured capsule with a white icon on the left; section headers show a matching small icon before the uppercase title. Status pips and value colours highlight active state: the Kodi row shows a green pip + green "On" when enabled, the API keys value turns green when all three are set.

  * lib/features/settings/widgets/settings_tile.dart (SettingsTile): Add `leadingIcon`, `leadingColor`, `statusDotColor`, `valueColor` params.
  * lib/features/settings/widgets/settings_group.dart (SettingsGroup): Add `titleIcon`, `titleIconColor`.
  * lib/features/settings/screens/settings_screen.dart: Populate icons / colours across tiles.

- **Compact sizing on narrow screens (<600px)**

  Across the Settings screen and the global top-bar search field, font sizes, icon sizes, and vertical padding shrink for mobile using the existing `isCompactScreen` helper. Desktop (≥600px) layout unchanged.

  * lib/features/settings/widgets/settings_tile.dart, settings_group.dart, lib/shared/widgets/app_top_bar.dart: Branch sizing on `isCompactScreen`.

- **Explicit Save button in every settings input field** (UX breaking)

  `InlineTextField` used to auto-save on focus loss, which was implicit and inconsistent with the rest of the UI; SteamGridDB and TMDB key fields additionally wrote to prefs on every keystroke. Every settings field (Author name; IGDB Client ID / Secret; SteamGridDB and TMDB API keys; Kodi Host / Port / Username / Password) now shows an orange "✓ Save" pill flush to the right edge of the field while there are unsaved changes. Tapping outside cancels and reverts. Enter still commits. The Save pill listens to raw `onPointerDown` so clicks commit before the TextField blurs itself on desktop mouse input.

  * lib/features/settings/widgets/inline_text_field.dart (InlineTextField): Remove auto-save-on-blur; add explicit Save pill.

- **Unified StatusDot + sync-icon row on all API key sections**

  IGDB, SteamGridDB, and TMDB blocks end in the same row: a coloured StatusDot (green ✓ connected / red ✕ error / grey ? unknown) on the left, a circular sync (↻) IconButton on the right to rerun validation. Reset button sits between them when a built-in default is available. The old separate "Connection Status" SettingsGroup with StatusDot + "Platforms available: N" row + full-width "Verify Connection" button is folded into the IGDB credentials card. SteamGridDB and TMDB now track their last-validation result locally.

  * lib/features/settings/widgets/credentials_content.dart: Unify three API sections; track last-validation locally for SteamGridDB and TMDB.

- **Kodi settings: Target Collection elevated to the top**

  It's the most consequential choice and the picker works offline; the section now precedes Connection. When the referenced collection has been deleted externally, `targetCollectionId` is cleared automatically on open (a guard flag prevents the post-frame callback from stacking across rebuilds). While no valid target is selected, Enable sync, Sync interval, Sub-collections, and Import ratings all render as disabled. The "Test connection" row is replaced by the same StatusDot + sync-icon pattern used on the API key sections.

  * lib/features/settings/screens/kodi_screen.dart: Reorder sections; add post-frame target-cleanup guard.

### Removed

- **`Platforms available` row and the standalone Connection Status group in IGDB credentials**

  The metric didn't justify its space; the connection status lives inside the IGDB credentials card now.

  * lib/features/settings/widgets/credentials_content.dart: Remove the group; fold StatusDot + sync-icon pattern into the IGDB credentials card.

- **Standalone Gamepad Debug entry in the main Settings screen**

  Still reachable from the Debug Hub in `kDebugMode` builds. Orphan localization key `settingsGamepadDebugSubtitle` deleted from both ARBs.

  * lib/features/settings/screens/settings_screen.dart: Remove entry.
  * lib/l10n/app_en.arb, app_ru.arb: Remove orphan key.

- **"Tier list" entry in a collection's three-dot menu**

  The duplicate shortcut that opened the global tier lists list for the current collection is gone; the "Create tier list from this collection" action remains.

  * lib/features/collections/screens/collection_screen.dart: Remove menu entry.

## [0.27.0] - 2026-04-18

### Changed
- **Tags sorted alphabetically (case-insensitive)** — in Manage Tags dialog and in the item tag picker. Previously DAO ordering (`sort_order ASC, name ASC`) combined with `sort_order=0` for every tag fell back to SQLite binary `name ASC` sort, which mixed case and Cyrillic unexpectedly. Sorting is now applied in `CollectionTagsNotifier` on `build`/`create`/`rename`/`refresh` via lowercase `compareTo` (`collection_tags_provider.dart`)

### Fixed
- **Search field did not react to typing when opened from a collection or wishlist** — the global `AppTopBar` search field is bound to the active tab's query provider (`searchContextFor(activeTab)`), but `SearchScreen` always reads `searchTabQueryProvider`. When pushed from a collection's `+` button or a wishlist item, the active tab stayed `Collections`/`Wishlist`, so keystrokes went into the wrong provider and the screen saw nothing. `SearchScreen` now accepts an `isPushed` flag; callers (`CollectionActions.addItems`, `WishlistScreen`) push via `rootNavigator: true` and pass `isPushed: true`, which makes the screen render its own `Scaffold`/`AppBar` with a `TextField` wired directly to `searchTabQueryProvider`. Controller initializes from the current provider value so reopening the screen restores the last query (`search_screen.dart`, `collection_actions.dart`, `wishlist_screen.dart`)
- **`SharedPreferences.setPrefix` threw `StateError` on in-process restart** — `setPrefix('flutter_dev.')` was called inside `_loadAppState()`, which runs again from `AppRestartScope._restart()` after the first `getInstance()`. The second call violated the library precondition and was swallowed by `runZonedGuarded` as a severe log. Moved to `main()` before the first `_loadAppState()` so it runs exactly once per process (`main.dart`)

### Changed
- **Table view drag-and-drop reorder** — `CollectionTableView` accepts an optional `onReorder` callback; when set, renders a `ReorderableListView` with a drag handle per row and disables column-click sort/filter (manual order takes priority). `CollectionItemsView` wires `onReorder` when `sortMode == manual && canEdit`, reusing the existing `reorderItem()` notifier/DAO pipeline (`collection_table_view.dart`, `collection_items_view.dart`)
- **Table view visual polish** — zebra row striping (alpha 10) replaces the thin divider; thumbnails grow from 32×46 to 36×52 with increased row padding; header labels become UPPERCASE with 0.8 letter-spacing and softer `textTertiary` color; status chip gains a 6px colored dot before its label; empty rating/tag cells render blank instead of an em-dash; hover tint bumped from alpha 12 to 22 (`collection_table_view.dart`)
- **Home status filter defaults to "All"** — previously the Home tab defaulted to showing only `inProgress` items, so new users had to discover the filter to see everything. Now defaults to `null` (All); user choice still persists per profile (`collections_provider.dart`)

## [0.26.0] - 2026-04-16

### Added
- **Time Spent tracking** — per-item time logging in collection. Timer icon with `Xh Ym` value in the item detail header row (next to source badge and media type). Tap to open hours+minutes input dialog — entered value replaces the total. Stored as `time_spent_minutes` column in `collection_items` (DB migration v34). Included in `.xcollx` export when "Include user data" is enabled. Header row changed from `Row` to `Wrap` to prevent overflow with many elements (`add_time_dialog.dart`, `media_detail_view.dart`, `item_detail_screen.dart`, `collection_item.dart`, `collection_dao.dart`, `collections_provider.dart`)
- **Service status badges in top bar** — desktop-only SVG icons for Kodi sync and Discord RPC in the app header, between the search field and settings gear. Brand-colored (Kodi blue, Discord blurple) when connected/running, gray when stopped/disconnected. Kodi icon pulses during active sync cycle. Click to toggle: Kodi start/stop sync timer, Discord connect/disconnect IPC. Tooltip shows current status. Uses polling-based `serviceStatusProvider` (2s interval with `ref.read`) to avoid badge flicker from settings invalidation. `DiscordRpcService.isConnected` / `isEnabled` public getters. SVG assets: `icon_discord.svg`, `icon_kodi.svg` (`service_badges.dart`, `service_status_provider.dart`, `app_top_bar.dart`, `discord_rpc_service.dart`, `app_assets.dart`)
- **Kodi watch sync** — background sync service that periodically polls Kodi VideoLibrary via JSON-RPC, matches movies to TMDB, and syncs watch status/ratings/dates to local collections. First sync cycle auto-populates the target collection with all Kodi movies; subsequent cycles update existing items and add new ones. Sub-collections from Kodi movie sets (e.g. "Harry Potter Collection (kodi)"). Per-profile settings with connection config, sync interval (30s–15min), import ratings toggle. Unified KodiScreen in Settings: connection test, sync controls, debug panel with request log and raw JSON-RPC console. TMDB `/find/{id}` endpoint for IMDB→TMDB resolution. New DAO methods: `findAllCollectionItems()`, `findCollectionByName()`. Models: KodiMovie, KodiTvShow, KodiEpisode, KodiUniqueIds, KodiApplicationInfo, KodiDateParser (`kodi_api.dart`, `kodi_sync_service.dart`, `kodi_settings_provider.dart`, `kodi_screen.dart`, `tmdb_api.dart`, `collection_dao.dart`)
- **Item status logic extracted to pure functions** — `computeDatesForStatus()`, `computeStatusForDates()`, `computeStatusFromProgress()`, `mergeExternalStatus()` centralize all status/date transition rules. Used by collections provider, episode tracker, and all external sync services (RA, Steam, Trakt, Kodi). 617 lines of pure unit tests with full branch coverage (`item_status_logic.dart`, `collections_provider.dart`, `episode_tracker_provider.dart`, `ra_sync_helpers.dart`, `steam_import_service.dart`, `trakt_zip_import_service.dart`)
- **Anime (AniList) as new media type** — `MediaType.anime` for Japanese anime with full AniList metadata: episodes, duration, format (TV/OVA/Movie/ONA/Special), source material (Original/Manga/Light Novel), studios, season, banner image for backdrop. New `anime_cache` table (DB migration v33), `AnimeDao`, `ImageType.animeCover`, `AppColors.animeAccent` (pink). AniList GraphQL queries extended with `duration`, `source`, `bannerImage`, `nextAiringEpisode`. Full integration: search (browse + filters), add to collection, detail card with chips, canvas, export/import, backup. `AniListAnimeSource` activated in search sources. Anime filter chip added to collection filter bar and Home/All Items screen. 5 localization keys EN+RU (`anime_dao.dart`, `migration_v33.dart`, `anime_progress_section.dart`, `anilist_anime_source.dart`, + ~35 files updated)
- **Anime episode progress tracker** — `AnimeProgressSection` with progress bar, "+1 episode" button, manual edit dialog, "Mark as completed" button, and next airing episode info for ongoing anime. Auto-status: +1 from zero → inProgress, mark completed → completed, reset to 0 → notStarted, dropped untouched. Uses existing `currentEpisode` field (no migration needed) (`anime_progress_section.dart`, `collections_provider.dart`)
- **CopyableText shared widget** — extracted from `ScreenAppBar._CopyableTitle` into reusable `CopyableText` widget. Accepts any child widget + text to copy. Now used in both `ScreenAppBar` and `ItemDetailsSheet` title. Tap to copy, hover shows copy/check icon (`copyable_text.dart`, `screen_app_bar.dart`, `item_details_sheet.dart`)
- **MediaProgressRow shared widget** — extracted progress row (label + value + progress bar + increment button) from `MangaProgressSection` into reusable `MediaProgressRow`. Now shared between manga and anime progress sections, eliminating code duplication (`media_progress_row.dart`, `manga_progress_section.dart`, `anime_progress_section.dart`)
- **Discord Rich Presence** — shows currently viewed collection item in Discord status (desktop only). Displays activity verb (Playing/Watching/Reading) + item name, platform/progress/year, elapsed timer. RetroAchievements-linked games show RA icon with achievement progress (earned/total) and award status (Beaten/Mastered). Toggle in Settings > Appearance. Auto-connects on app launch if enabled, lazy reconnect if Discord starts later. Uses `dart_discord_presence` package via IPC pipe (`discord_rpc_service.dart`, `settings_provider.dart`, `settings_screen.dart`, `item_detail_screen.dart`, `platform_features.dart`). 2 localization keys EN+RU
- **Discord RetroAchievements sync** — optional mode that polls RA profile every 30 seconds and streams live emulator activity to Discord. Shows game title + platform (fetched via `getGameSummary`), in-game Rich Presence string from emulator, and achievement progress. Game info cached per session to minimize API calls. When RA sync is active, collection card presence is suppressed. Toggle appears in Settings when Discord RPC is on and RA credentials are configured. `RaUserProfile.lastGameId` field added, `RaApi.getGameSummary()` lightweight endpoint. 2 localization keys EN+RU (`discord_rpc_service.dart`, `settings_provider.dart`, `settings_screen.dart`, `ra_api.dart`, `ra_user_profile.dart`)
- **Gyroscope parallax effect (Android)** — backdrop images in item detail card and search detail sheet subtly shift based on device tilt, creating a depth illusion behind the content overlay. Uses `sensors_plus` for gyroscope data with smooth lerp interpolation. Desktop renders statically (`gyroscope_parallax_image.dart`, `media_detail_view.dart`, `item_details_sheet.dart`)
- **Discord RetroAchievements sync** — optional mode that polls RA profile every 30 seconds and streams live emulator activity to Discord. Shows game title + platform (fetched via `getGameSummary`), in-game Rich Presence string from emulator, and achievement progress. Game info cached per session to minimize API calls. When RA sync is active, collection card presence is suppressed. Toggle appears in Settings when Discord RPC is on and RA credentials are configured. `RaUserProfile.lastGameId` field added, `RaApi.getGameSummary()` lightweight endpoint. 2 localization keys EN+RU (`discord_rpc_service.dart`, `settings_provider.dart`, `settings_screen.dart`, `ra_api.dart`, `ra_user_profile.dart`)

### Changed
- **Notes auto-save** — user notes and author comments now auto-save with 1-second debounce while typing. Also saves on dispose (leaving the screen). No more losing notes by forgetting to press the check button. Check button still works — it saves immediately and exits edit mode (`media_detail_view.dart`)
- **App shell redesign (liquid sidebar + adaptive bottom bar)** — navigation replaced: desktop gets a 72px rail with liquid-morphing selection indicator (`LiquidIndicator`), mobile gets a matching 64px bottom bar. Deleted the old `navigation_shell.dart` (~625 lines) and its 371-line test suite. New files: `app_shell.dart`, `app_sidebar.dart`, `app_bottom_bar.dart`, `liquid_indicator.dart`, `nav_icon_button.dart`, `nav_destinations.dart`, `nav_tab.dart` (`lib/shared/navigation/`)
- **Global app top bar with contextual search** — persistent `AppTopBar` replaces per-screen search fields. Hosts centered search field that is wired to the active tab's query provider, a settings gear with update badge, and an F1 shortcut hint. Per-tab query state lives in `search_providers.dart` (`collectionsSearchQueryProvider`, `allItemsSearchQueryProvider`, plus existing per-feature providers). Typing anywhere on a screen with no focused editable routes characters into the top-bar field (`app_top_bar.dart`, `search_providers.dart`, `app_shell.dart`)
- **DraggableFab replaces per-screen AppBar actions** — screen actions (create, import, toggle view, sort direction, extra menu, export, rename, delete…) are now exposed via a repositionable Fan menu attached to a single circular FAB. Primary actions fan horizontally; secondary actions fan vertically with dividers. Drag to relocate, tap to open (`draggable_fab.dart`, applied across Home, Collection, Wishlist, Tier Lists, Settings sub-screens)
- **Chevron filter bar with segmented media-type selector** — new `ChevronSegment` and `StatusDropdownSegment` primitives form a full-width row of connected chevrons. Active segment tints with media accent (`MediaTypeTheme.colorFor`), inactive segments tint faintly. Compact mode (<700px) collapses labels to icons. Used by `CollectionFilterBar` (`lib/shared/widgets/chevron_filter_bar.dart`) and by the redesigned search `FilterBar` (`lib/features/search/widgets/filter_bar.dart`)
- **Bottom-sheet filters on narrow screens** — collection and search filters collapse to a `DraggableScrollableSheet` with a drag handle, radial accent glow, and per-row sort/filter controls. Opened via a tune-icon chevron button in the filter bar. Applied to `CollectionFilterSheet` and the new `FilterSheet` (`collection_filter_sheet.dart`, `filter_sheet.dart`)
- **Unified SubScreenTitleBar on all sub-screens** — 44px title bar with back button (auto-hidden when nothing to pop) and bottom border, replacing `ScreenAppBar` in settings, debug, profile-picker, tier-list-detail, wishlist, and collection screens (`sub_screen_title_bar.dart`)
- **Search filter bar consolidated into chevrons** — `FilterBar` (browse mode) now builds the same chevron row that `CollectionFilterBar` uses: first chevron is source picker (accent-tinted per group), followed by source-specific filter chevrons and a sort chevron; TMDB sources show a compact Customize chevron. On narrow screens collapses to `[Source][🎚 Filters (N)][Customize?]` with a sheet. Clear button appears only when filters are active. Deleted: in-bar `SourceDropdown`/`FilterDropdown`/`SortDropdown` fixed-height-36 variants (`filter_bar.dart`)
- **All Items filters redesigned** — `AllItemsScreen` filter row uses the same chevron segments as collection view with media-type counts inline. Platform dropdown extracted into sheet on narrow screens (`all_items_screen.dart`)
- **Wishlist and Tier Lists adapted to new shell** — removed custom `ScreenAppBar` wiring, actions moved to `DraggableFab`, list and grid styles unchanged (`wishlist_screen.dart`, `tier_lists_screen.dart`, `tier_list_detail_screen.dart`)
- **Settings sub-screens use standard AppBar** — `credentials_screen`, `cache_screen`, `debug_hub_screen`, `credits_screen`, `database_screen`, `profiles_screen`, `steam_import_screen`, `ra_import_screen`, `trakt_import_screen`, `browse_collections_screen`, `gamepad_debug_screen`, `steamgriddb_debug_screen`, `import_result_screen` now use `SubScreenTitleBar` or platform `AppBar` and integrate with global top bar search (~13 screens updated)
- **Search chevron filter sentinel unified** — `filter_dropdown.dart`, `filter_bar.dart`, and `filter_sheet.dart` share one `kFilterResetSentinel` so the "All" option in the searchable dialog clears the filter regardless of entry point. Shared `filterAccentForGroup` utility extracted to `lib/features/search/utils/filter_ui.dart`, replacing the duplicate `_accentForGroup` helper in `filter_bar.dart` and `filter_sheet.dart` (`filter_ui.dart`)
- **Platform list extraction is now cached** — `CollectionFilterBar._extractPlatforms()` caches its result by item-list identity instead of recomputing every rebuild (`collection_filter_bar.dart`)
- **Discover Customize visibility** — TMDB "Customize feed" chevron stays visible when filters are selected (Customize IS the filter/sort configuration of the feed); it only hides when an actual text search is active, at which point the feed becomes search results (`filter_bar.dart`)
- **ItemDetailsSheet narrow-screen polish** — search/discover detail sheet adapts to narrow windows and phones: below 500px width the header switches to a stacked layout (hero poster centered on top, info column full-width below so genres/tags get the whole sheet width instead of a ~220px strip beside the cover). The `+` add button moved from its own drag-handle row to a `Positioned` overlay in the top-right, reclaiming ~50px of header height; info column reserves 48px right padding in row mode so the button never covers the title. Backdrop gained two improvements: falls back to the poster with strong blur (`ImageFilter.blur` sigma=40, denser gradient) as an ambient background when no dedicated backdrop is available, and switches from `BoxFit.cover`/`center` to `BoxFit.fitWidth`/`topCenter` for real backdrops so landscape images show their full width at the top instead of being cropped to a center slice (`item_details_sheet.dart`)

## [0.25.1] - 2026-04-10

### Added
- **Copy title from AppBar** — clicking the title in `ScreenAppBar` copies it to clipboard. Hover shows copy icon, turns to checkmark on success. Works on all screens with titles (`screen_app_bar.dart`)
- **Wishlist context menu** — right-click (desktop) and long press (mobile) on wishlist items opens context menu with Search, Edit, Resolve/Unresolve, and Delete actions. Replaced trailing `PopupMenuButton` with `showMenu` at cursor/touch position (`wishlist_screen.dart`)
- **Unified ItemDetailsSheet** — merged 4 separate detail bottom sheets (`GameDetailsSheet`, `MediaDetailsSheet`, `MangaDetailsSheet`, `VnDetailsSheet`) into single modular `ItemDetailsSheet` with factory constructors (`.movie()`, `.tvShow()`, `.game()`, `.manga()`, `.visualNovel()`). Redesigned UI: rounded sheet with elevation and tiled background pattern, full-bleed backdrop image with gradient fade, translucent content card, circular floating "+" add button. 3 deleted files (~900 lines), 1 new file (~600 lines) (`item_details_sheet.dart`, `search_screen.dart`, `discover_feed.dart`, `recommendations_section.dart`)
- **Backdrop in item detail card** — full-bleed backdrop with vertical gradient fade (matching search sheet style), content wrapped in frosted-glass container. Games use IGDB artwork (`artwork_url`), manga uses AniList banner (`banner_url`). DB migration v32. All backdrop URLs persisted to DB (`media_detail_view.dart`)
- **Detailed API error info with copy button** — all 7 API clients now capture full debug info on errors: API name, request URL+method, HTTP status, DioException type, underlying cause, and response body excerpt. Error display shows user-friendly message with "Copy error details" button. New files: `api_error_detail.dart`, `api_error_extract.dart`, `api_error_display.dart`. 2 localization keys EN+RU
- **API connection timeouts** — all 7 API clients now have 5-second `connectTimeout` and `receiveTimeout` (was unlimited). Prevents UI from hanging indefinitely on network issues

### Changed
- **RA platform mapping expanded and fixed** — `consolePlatformMap` changed from `Map<int, int>` to `Map<int, List<int>>` to support IGDB aliases (Super Famicom, Family Computer, Neo Geo Pocket Color, WonderSwan Color, etc.). Fixed 7 incorrect mappings (Game Gear→Nintendo DS, Atari Jaguar→Atari 7800, Nintendo DS→Xbox One, Virtual Boy→ColecoVision, ColecoVision→Vectrex, Atari 7800→Atari Jaguar, Game & Watch→Game Gear). Added 22 new platforms (Amstrad CPC, Apple II, Intellivision, Vectrex, PC-8800, Atari 5200, Fairchild Channel F, Arduboy, Arcadia 2001, etc.). New `primaryIgdbPlatformId()` helper for forward lookup. Total: 56 RA→IGDB mappings (was 34) (`ra_to_igdb_mapper.dart`, `ra_import_service.dart`)
- **Star rating bar reduced** — default star size decreased from 28px to 24px to prevent overflow in narrower layouts (`star_rating_bar.dart`)
- **Search sources preserve typed exceptions** — VNDB, AniList anime, and AniList manga search sources now `rethrow` instead of wrapping in `Exception(e.message)`, preserving error detail for the UI

## [0.25.0] - 2026-04-08

### Added
- **RetroAchievements tracker system** — universal tracker infrastructure with 3 new database tables (`tracker_profiles`, `tracker_game_data`, `tracker_achievements`). RA achievements section in game detail card: stats block (total/unlocked/points/HC), beaten progress panel (progression + win condition bars), achievement list with badge icons, type indicators (missable/progression/win condition), filter chips, award badges (RA-style colored circles: gold=Mastered, silver=Beaten, outline=Softcore). Data loads lazily when opening a game card. Tracker data included in xcollx export (with "Include user data") and full backups. RA credentials saved on Verify Connection (no import required). DB migration v31. 30+ localization keys EN+RU
- **Link/Unlink RetroAchievements** — RA logo badge in game detail header row (next to IGDB/platform badges). Linked: full-color logo, click opens RA game page. Unlinked: pulsing semi-transparent logo, click opens search dialog to link. "Unlink" button in RA section header with confirmation. Search dialog loads game list from RA API by console, local filtering with exact/prefix/contains ranking. `RaApi.getGameList()` + `RaGameListEntry` model. `TrackerDao.deleteGameData()` with cascading achievement cleanup. Reverse platform mapping `igdbToRaConsoleIds()`. 12 localization keys EN+RU (`ra_link_dialog.dart`, `ra_api.dart`, `ra_to_igdb_mapper.dart`, `tracker_provider.dart`, `tracker_dao.dart`, `item_detail_screen.dart`)
- **RA date and status sync** — opening a game card with RA data syncs `startedAt` (first earned achievement), `lastActivityAt` (most recent earned), `completedAt` (award date), and `status` to `collection_items`. Status rules: beaten/mastered → completed, >0 achievements + >90 days inactive → dropped (blocked for notStarted/planned items), >0 achievements → inProgress, 0 achievements → no change. Shared `syncRaDataToCollectionItem()` helper used by both import and per-game refresh. `GetGameInfoAndUserProgress` now uses `a=1` param for award data. Optimistic UI updates without full list reload (`ra_sync_helpers.dart`, `tracker_provider.dart`, `tracker_sync_service.dart`, `collections_provider.dart`, `ra_game_progress.dart`, `ra_import_service.dart`)
- **Unified ItemDetailsSheet** — merged 4 separate detail bottom sheets (`GameDetailsSheet`, `MediaDetailsSheet`, `MangaDetailsSheet`, `VnDetailsSheet`) into single modular `ItemDetailsSheet` with factory constructors (`.movie()`, `.tvShow()`, `.game()`, `.manga()`, `.visualNovel()`). Redesigned UI: rounded sheet with elevation and tiled background pattern, full-bleed backdrop image with gradient fade (visible at top, dissolving to dark at bottom), translucent content card, circular floating "+" add button in header with hover scale effect, `SourceBadge` with external link, year inline with title, compact genre chips. Modular parameters: `subtitle`, `infoChips`, `extraInfoIcon`, `maxGenres`, `coverHeight`. 3 deleted files (~900 lines), 1 new file (~600 lines). `_RecPosterCard` and `_DiscoverPosterCard` replaced with unified `MediaPosterCard` — consistent hover effects, rating badges, and "in collection" indicators across search, discover, and recommendations (`item_details_sheet.dart`, `search_screen.dart`, `discover_feed.dart`, `recommendations_section.dart`)
- **Adaptive card variant** — poster cards automatically use `CardVariant.compact` on mobile (<600px) and `CardVariant.grid` on desktop across all screens: Main (all items), collection grid, search results, discover feed, recommendations
- **Table view horizontal scroll** — collection table view scrolls horizontally on narrow screens (<600px) with minimum width 600px, keeping all columns visible instead of overflowing
- **Backdrop in item detail card** — movies, TV shows, games, and manga display backdrop image as background in the detail card (gradient fade, 40% screen height). Movies/TV use TMDB backdrop, games use IGDB artwork (`artwork_url` in `games`), manga uses AniList banner (`banner_url` in `manga_cache`). DB migration v32. All backdrop URLs persisted to DB, included in export/import. Visible through content with diagonal + vertical transparency
- **Update warning dialog** — tapping "Update available" in Settings now shows a warning dialog reminding users to create a backup before updating. Explains that the app is in active development and database migrations may change data format. 3 localization keys EN+RU
- **App version in backup filename** — backup ZIP now named `tonkatsu-backup-v{version}-{date}.zip` and manifest includes `app_version` field
- **Browse Online Collections** — new screen in Settings > Import to browse and download pre-built collections from the `tonkatsu-collections` GitHub repository. Features searchable dropdown filters for platform (32 platforms) and category, text search, download with progress indicator, and automatic import via existing `ImportService`. Supports `.xcoll`, `.xcollx`, and `.zip` files. 16 localization keys EN+RU (`collection_browser_service.dart`, `collections_index.dart`, `collection_browser_provider.dart`, `browse_collections_screen.dart`, `browse_collections_content.dart`, `settings_screen.dart`)
- **Table view inline editing** — click Rating cell to set 1–10 stars via popup (with hover highlight and clear button), click Status chip to change status via dropdown (5 options with colored icons, auto-sets `startedAt`/`completedAt`), click Tag cell to assign/remove tag via popup. All editable only when collection is not locked (`collection_table_view.dart`, `collection_items_view.dart`)
- **Tag column in table view** — new `TableColumn.tag` between Status and Rating. Colored chip for assigned tag, em-dash when untagged. Supports cyclic header filter and alphabetical sorting (`collection_table_view.dart`)
- **Platform cyclic filter** — clicking Platform column header now cycles through platform values (like Status/Type/Rating) instead of toggling sort direction. Header shows current filter value (`collection_table_view.dart`)
- **Tag sidebar** — vertical bookmark-style panel on the right side of collection view (desktop only). Appears when 1+ tags exist. Multi-select: click tags to toggle. "Group" button at top toggles tag grouping mode — sorts items by tag and adds animated color-coded border (rotating highlight) around each tagged poster. Stale tag IDs auto-cleaned from filter on tag deletion (`tag_sidebar.dart`, `collection_screen.dart`, `collection_items_view.dart`, `media_poster_card.dart`)
- **Tag name search** — text search in collection (search bar + type-to-filter) and All Items screen now matches item name OR tag name. `TagDao.getAll()` and `allTagsMapProvider` for cross-collection tag lookup (`collection_screen.dart`, `all_items_screen.dart`, `all_items_provider.dart`, `tag_dao.dart`)
- **Tag display on All Items** — poster cards on the Home/All Items screen now show tag name and color badge, same as in collection view (`all_items_screen.dart`)
- **Tag grouping on mobile** — "Group" chip with icon in mobile filter bottom sheet toggles tag grouping mode (same as desktop sidebar button) (`collection_filter_bar.dart`, `collection_screen.dart`)
- **HSL color picker for tags** — tag management dialog now includes a palette of 18 preset colors plus HSL sliders (Hue/Saturation/Lightness) with gradient tracks, live preview, and hex code display. Color dot on each tag row opens the picker. "No color" button to reset (`tag_management_dialog.dart`)
- **Overlay toggle settings** — two switches in Settings > Appearance to independently enable/disable platform overlays on game posters (PS5, Switch, etc.) and Blu-ray overlays on movie/TV show posters. Animation posters have no Blu-ray overlay. When disabled, plain cover images are shown. Applied across collection grid, detail screen, tier lists, all items screen, and tier list PNG export. `SettingsState.resolveOverlayFor()` helper for consistent overlay resolution (`settings_provider.dart`, `settings_screen.dart`, `collection_items_view.dart`, `item_detail_screen.dart`, `all_items_screen.dart`, `tier_item_card.dart`, `tier_list_view.dart`, `tier_row.dart`, `tier_list_export_view.dart`, `tier_list_detail_screen.dart`)
- 15 localization keys EN+RU: `tagSidebarAll`, `colorPickerTitle`, `colorPickerNoColor`, `colorPickerApply`, `settingsShowPlatformOverlay`, `settingsShowPlatformOverlaySubtitle`, `settingsShowBlurayOverlay`, `settingsShowBlurayOverlaySubtitle`, `collectionFilterSearchHint`, `collectionFilterSort`, `collectionFilterAscending`, `collectionFilterDescending`, `collectionFilterFilters`, `collectionFilterClearAll`, `collectionFilterPlatform`

### Changed
- **RA achievements section redesigned** — removed dark container background and custom border, unified with app theme: `AppTypography.h3` header, `AppTypography.caption` stats, `AppColors.surfaceBorder` dividers. Expand/collapse button moved above achievement list (always visible); collapse button also shown at bottom when expanded. 50/50 side-by-side layout with notes on wide screens, stacked on mobile (`ra_achievements_section.dart`, `media_detail_view.dart`)
- **Steam import: batch lookup by Steam App ID** — replaced per-game IGDB name search (65 HTTP requests) with batch lookup via `external_games` endpoint (2 requests). Exact matching by Steam `appid` instead of fuzzy name search. Collection is created lazily — only after successful Steam library fetch, preventing empty collections on API errors. `rtime_last_played` now stored as `lastActivityAt` (was incorrectly stored as `startedAt`) (`igdb_api.dart`, `steam_import_service.dart`, `steam_import_content.dart`)
- **RA import: batch IGDB search via multiquery** — replaced per-game IGDB search (N requests with 300ms delay) with batched multiquery (10 games per request, ~10x fewer HTTP calls). Removed separate `getUserAwardDates` API call — `HighestAwardDate` is now parsed directly from `GetUserCompletionProgress` response. `MostRecentAwardedDate` stored as `lastActivityAt` only (was incorrectly stored as `startedAt`). Lazy collection creation on error. Progress updates during IGDB batch search. `RaToIgdbMapper.bestMatch()` extracted as public static for reuse (`ra_import_service.dart`, `ra_to_igdb_mapper.dart`, `ra_import_content.dart`, `ra_game_progress.dart`)
- **Default collection sort: Last Activity** — new `CollectionSortMode.lastActivity` sorts items by `lastActivityAt` (most recent first, items without activity at the bottom). Set as default sort mode for new collections. 3 localization keys EN+RU (`collection_sort_mode.dart`, `sort_utils.dart`, `collections_provider.dart`)
- **Welcome wizard updated** — added Tier Lists tab to "How it Works" step (step 5), added rate limit warning for built-in API keys at the top of API Keys step (step 4), separated open/copy actions in API link cards (open_in_new opens URL, content_copy copies to clipboard). Fixed step number comments (2→4, 3→5, 4→6). Localized snackbar message. 2 localization keys EN+RU: `welcomeHowTierListsDesc`, `welcomeApiRateLimitHint` (`welcome_step_api_keys.dart`, `welcome_step_how_it_works.dart`, `welcome_step_ready.dart`)
- **Empty states unified** — all main tabs (Home, Collections, Tier Lists, Wishlist) now use consistent empty state style: 64px muted icon, `h2` title in `textTertiary`, `body` hint in `textSecondary` with `textAlign: center`. Tier Lists gained icon and "Tap +" hint. Home hint now shows step-by-step guidance. Collections hint updated from "gaming journey" to "media library". 2 localization keys EN+RU: `tierListEmptyHint`, updated `allItemsAddViaCollections`, `collectionsNoCollectionsHint` (`tier_lists_screen.dart`, `all_items_screen.dart`, `home_screen.dart`, `wishlist_screen.dart`)
- **Canvas toolbar reordered** — lock button moved before the list/board switch for better visual flow (`collection_screen.dart`)
- **Poster images use BoxFit.cover** — `MediaPosterCard` and `CollectionCard` changed from `BoxFit.contain` to `BoxFit.cover` for consistent image rendering across all screens, eliminating letterbox bars (`media_poster_card.dart`, `collection_card.dart`)
- **Open in collection dialog improved** — when a game exists in the same collection on multiple platforms, dialog now shows platform name and colored dot alongside collection name, making entries distinguishable (`search_screen.dart`)
- **Collection filter bar redesigned** — media type dropdown replaced with horizontal `ChoiceChip` row supporting multi-select. Platform and tag filters moved into a collapsible panel (desktop: expand arrow with `AnimatedCrossFade`; mobile: bottom sheet with `ChoiceChip` groups). Search field and sort button remain in the main row. View toggle (Grid/Table) moved to AppBar. Clear button resets all active filters. `CollectionFilterBar` converted from `ConsumerWidget` to `ConsumerStatefulWidget` (`collection_filter_bar.dart`, `collection_screen.dart`)
- **Tag grouping redesigned** — replaced section dividers with flat sorted grid. When grouping is active (via sidebar "Group" button or mobile filter chip), items are sorted by tag with animated color-coded borders on tagged poster cards. Layout unchanged — same grid columns, no dividers. Desktop tag chips removed from filter bar expand panel (managed by TagSidebar) (`collection_items_view.dart`, `collection_filter_bar.dart`, `media_poster_card.dart`)
- **View toggle simplified** — collection view mode cycles Grid → Table → Grid (List view temporarily hidden). Toggle button moved from filter bar to AppBar (`collection_screen.dart`)

### Removed
- **Breadcrumbs navigation** — removed entire breadcrumb system (`BreadcrumbScope`, `BreadcrumbAppBar`, `AutoBreadcrumbAppBar`) and all BreadcrumbScope wrappers from 25 screens. Replaced with `ScreenAppBar` — compact 44px AppBar with subtle gradient border, localized titles on all screens, and automatic back button on mobile. Deleted `breadcrumb_scope.dart`, `breadcrumb_app_bar.dart`, `auto_breadcrumb_app_bar.dart` and their tests (~2300 lines removed). Added `screen_app_bar.dart` (~100 lines)
- **Media type legend** — removed `MediaTypeLegend` widget from Home screen. Color-coded filter chips already convey the same information (`media_type_legend.dart` deleted, `all_items_screen.dart`)

### Fixed
- **Tag group button clears selection** — pressing "Group" button in tag sidebar or mobile filter now clears all selected tag filters, resetting the view to show all items (`collection_screen.dart`)
- **Color picker dialog overflow** — HSL color picker dialog content wrapped in `SingleChildScrollView` to prevent 257px bottom overflow on small screens (`tag_management_dialog.dart`)
- **Cover image distortion on detail screen** — removed `memCacheHeight` from detail view cover decoding. Specifying both `cacheWidth` and `cacheHeight` forced Flutter to decode into a fixed aspect ratio, distorting non-standard images (`media_detail_view.dart`)
- **Tag assignment flickers all images** — assigning a tag to a single collection item no longer causes all poster images to reload. Replaced `ref.invalidate()` / `refresh()` (which set `AsyncLoading` and reloaded all items from DB) with optimistic `updateItemTag()` that updates only the affected item in-place via `copyWith` (`collections_provider.dart`, `item_tags_section.dart`, `collection_items_view.dart`)

## [0.24.0] - 2026-03-31

### Added
- **Multi-platform items** — allow the same game on different platforms within one collection. Migration v30: conditional unique indexes (`idx_ci_coll_game` with `platform_id` for games, `idx_ci_coll_other` without for other media types; same split for uncategorized). Canvas sync updated to handle duplicate `external_id` items (count-based orphan removal instead of set-based). Export includes `platform_id` in tier list entries. Import mapping key includes `platform_id` for games (backward compatible — falls back to key without platform). Platform selection dialog shows already-added platforms with checkmark icon. Collection picker no longer blocks collections that already contain the game (same game on a different platform is allowed). `CollectedItemInfo.platformId` field added for per-platform tracking (`migration_v30.dart`, `schema.dart`, `database_service.dart`, `export_service.dart`, `import_service.dart`, `canvas_provider.dart`, `search_screen.dart`, `collection_dao.dart`, `collection_repository.dart`, `collected_item_info.dart`)
- **Platform overlay templates on poster cards** — 92 platform overlay PNG images (600×900) from SteamGridDB covering Sony, Nintendo, Microsoft, Sega, Atari, Neo Geo, NEC, and retro consoles. `Platform.overlayAsset` getter maps 75 IGDB platform IDs to overlay files. Overlay rendered on top of poster in `MediaPosterCard` (collection, home, tier list — not search), `TierItemCard`, and `MediaDetailView` cover image. Cards with overlay use square corners; cards without overlay keep rounded corners. Rating badge moves from poster to subtitle row as gold `★8 / 7.5` text for overlay cards. Text platform badge remains as fallback for unmapped platforms. Genre subtitle removed from all poster cards for cleaner layout (`platform.dart`, `media_poster_card.dart`, `tier_item_card.dart`, `media_detail_view.dart`, `item_detail_screen.dart`, `collection_items_view.dart`, `all_items_screen.dart`, `browse_grid.dart`, `pubspec.yaml`, `assets/images/platform_overlays/`)
- **Collection tags (sections)** — group items within a collection by custom tags/sections. `CollectionTag` model with `fromDb`/`fromExport`/`toDb`/`toExport`/`copyWith`. `TagDao` for CRUD and `setItemTag()`. DB migration v29 (create `collection_tags` table, add `tag_id` column to `collection_items` with `ON DELETE SET NULL`). `CollectionTagsNotifier` provider for async tag management. `TagManagementDialog` for creating, renaming, and deleting tags (accessible from collection menu). Items grouped by tag with section dividers in grid and list views (like AllItemsScreen grouping pattern). Tag badge on poster cards (bottom-right, colored) with tap-to-change popup menu. Tag selector chip in item detail header (next to source and type). Export includes `tags` array and `tag_name` per item; import restores tags and assignments by name. Orphaned tagIds gracefully fall back to "untagged" group. 14 localization keys EN+RU (`collection_tag.dart`, `tag_dao.dart`, `migration_v29.dart`, `collection_tags_provider.dart`, `tag_management_dialog.dart`, `item_tags_section.dart`, `collection_items_view.dart`, `media_poster_card.dart`, `media_detail_view.dart`, `collection_screen.dart`, `item_detail_screen.dart`, `export_service.dart`, `import_service.dart`, `xcoll_file.dart`, `schema.dart`)
- **Custom items** — manually create collection entries with custom title, cover (from file or URL), year, genres, platform, description, and rating. `CustomMedia` model with `fromDb`/`toDb`/`copyWith`/`toExport`. `CustomMediaDao` for CRUD. `CreateCustomItemDialog` with searchable multi-select genre picker (merged IGDB+TMDB genres), cover source dialog with 2:3 aspect ratio hint, star rating. Custom items support `displayType` — styled as game/movie/tv/etc with matching colors and icons on canvas, collection list, and detail screen. Local cover files cached via `ImageCacheService` with `local://cover` marker in DB. DB migrations v27 (create `custom_items` table) and v28 (add `display_type` column). Export/import support for custom items in `.xcoll`/`.xcollx` files. `MediaType.custom` added with theme colors. `AllItemsScreen`, `WishlistScreen`, `SearchScreen` updated for custom type. 30+ localization keys EN+RU (`custom_media.dart`, `custom_media_dao.dart`, `create_custom_item_dialog.dart`, `collections_provider.dart`, `canvas_provider.dart`, `collection_dao.dart`, `canvas_repository.dart`, `collection_repository.dart`, `schema.dart`, `migration_v27.dart`, `migration_v28.dart`)
- **Export with personal data** — optional "Include personal data" checkbox in export format dialog. When enabled, `.xcoll`/`.xcollx` files include user status, dates (started, completed, last activity), personal notes (user_comment), episode progress (current_season, current_episode), sort order, and added_at. New `user_data: true` flag in file header. Import auto-restores all user data when present; old files without the flag import as before (backward compatible). `CollectionItem.toExport({includeUserData})`, `XcollFile.includesUserData`, `ImportService._restoreUserData()`. 2 localization keys EN+RU. 14 new tests (`collection_item.dart`, `xcoll_file.dart`, `export_service.dart`, `import_service.dart`, `collection_actions.dart`, `app_en.arb`, `app_ru.arb`)
- **Full backup & restore** — one-button backup of all collections (full export with user data, canvas, images, tier lists), wishlist, and app settings into a single `.zip` archive. Restore from backup with confirmation dialog showing manifest preview (collection/item/wishlist counts), checkboxes for wishlist and settings restoration. Collections always created as new (no merge). Wishlist deduplicated by text. `BackupService` with `createBackup()`, `readManifest()`, `restoreFromBackup()`. `BackupManifest` model for ZIP metadata. Settings → Backup section with "Backup All Data" and "Restore from Backup" tiles. 15 localization keys EN+RU (`backup_service.dart`, `settings_screen.dart`, `app_en.arb`, `app_ru.arb`)

### Changed
- **Canvas provider refactored into 5 files** — split 1387-line `canvas_provider.dart` into `canvas_state.dart` (CanvasState + BaseCanvasController), `canvas_timer_mixin.dart` (debounce logic), `canvas_operations_mixin.dart` (15 shared CRUD methods), `canvas_provider.dart` (CanvasNotifier + barrel exports), `game_canvas_provider.dart` (GameCanvasNotifier). Eliminated ~200 lines of duplication between CanvasNotifier and GameCanvasNotifier via `CanvasOperationsMixin`. All existing imports unchanged via barrel exports
- **Tier list UX improvements** — added right-click context menu (rename/delete) on tier list cards for desktop (long press remains for Android). Added "+" button in tier list detail AppBar for adding new tiers. Removed "Add tier" option from tier row bottom sheet (now only accessible via AppBar button and Ctrl+Enter shortcut)
- **Trakt import: Trakt v3 export format support** — auto-detect flat ZIP structure (`trakt-export-*.zip`) from Trakt v3 alongside legacy nested format (`username/watched/*.json`). Username extracted from `user-profile.json` for new format. Both formats fully backward compatible (`trakt_zip_import_service.dart`)
- **Trakt import: own TMDB API key required** — import button disabled with warning banner when using built-in TMDB key. Directs user to add own key in Settings → Credentials (`trakt_import_content.dart`, 1 localization key EN+RU)

### Fixed
- **Imported games disappear after app restart** — `clearStaleGames()` on splash screen deleted games from cache when their `cached_at` timestamp (from the exported file) was older than 30 days. Removed all `clearStale*` methods (`clearStaleGames`, `clearStaleMovies`, `clearStaleTvShows`, `clearStaleEpisodes`) from splash screen startup, DAOs, DatabaseService, and GameRepository. Cache tables are lightweight and don't need periodic cleanup (`splash_screen.dart`, `game_dao.dart`, `movie_dao.dart`, `tv_show_dao.dart`, `database_service.dart`, `game_repository.dart`, `import_service.dart`)
- **Profile stats screen crashes app** — `ProfilesScreen._loadStats()` opened a second readonly SQLite connection to the same database file via `databaseFactory.openDatabase()`, then called `db.close()` which closed the singleton connection used by the entire app. All subsequent DB queries returned empty results. Fixed by passing the already-open `DatabaseService` for the current profile instead of opening a new connection (`profile_service.dart`, `profiles_screen.dart`)
- **Canvas image flicker** — fixed imported images (base64) flickering on every canvas interaction (pan, zoom, drag). `CanvasImageItem` converted from `ConsumerWidget` to `ConsumerStatefulWidget` to cache decoded bytes across rebuilds, with `gaplessPlayback: true` preventing blank frames (`canvas_image_item.dart`)
- **Table view column filtering** — clicking Status/Type/Rating headers now cycles through values present in the collection instead of just toggling asc/desc sort. Only values that exist in the current collection are shown. Filter resets when items change externally. `ItemStatus.genericLabel()` added for media-type-agnostic labels (`collection_table_view.dart`, `item_status.dart`)
- **Tier list drag flicker** — added `ValueKey` to tier rows, tier items, and unranked pool items to preserve widget identity across state rebuilds. Fixes all cards flickering when moving a single item between tiers (`tier_list_view.dart`, `tier_row.dart`)

## [0.23.0] - 2026-03-25

### Added
- **Search source grouping** — `SearchSource` now declares `groupId`, `groupName`, `groupIcon` for visual grouping in the source picker popup. `SourceDropdown` displays grouped items with section headers (TMDB, IGDB, AniList, VNDB) and dividers. `groupedSearchSources` helper in `search_sources.dart` auto-groups sources by `groupId`. No new providers — `browseProvider` remains the single source of truth. Adding a new source only requires implementing `SearchSource` and appending to the registry (`search_source.dart`, `source_dropdown.dart`, `search_sources.dart`, all 6 source files)
- **AniList Anime source (dormant)** — `Anime` model with `fromJson`/`fromDb`/`toDb`/`copyWith`, `AniListApi.browseAnime()`/`getAnimeById()`/`getAnimeByIds()` with GraphQL queries, `AniListAnimeSource` with genre and status filters. Source is not yet registered in `searchSources` — pending DB table, DAO, DetailsSheet, and browse_grid/search_screen integration. 7 localization keys EN+RU (`anime.dart`, `anilist_api.dart`, `anilist_anime_source.dart`, `anilist_anime_genre_filter.dart`, `anilist_anime_status_filter.dart`)
- **"Trending" sort option** — `BrowseSortOption.label()` now maps `'trending'` to localized "Trending" / "В тренде" (`search_source.dart`, `app_en.arb`, `app_ru.arb`)
- **Status filter on All Items screen** — dropdown chip in the media type chips row filters items by status (In Progress, Planned, Not Started, Completed, Dropped). Default: In Progress. Selection persisted in SharedPreferences via `homeStatusFilterProvider`. Replaces the previous Rating sort chip. Status icons and colors match item detail cards. `CollectionDao.getCollectionIdsWithStatus()` added for future collection-level filtering (`all_items_screen.dart`, `collections_provider.dart`, `collection_dao.dart`, `app_en.arb`, `app_ru.arb`)
- **User profiles** — multi-profile system with isolated databases and image caches per profile. `Profile` model (`id`, `name`, `color`, `createdAt`) stored in `profiles.json`. `ProfileService` handles CRUD, migration from legacy single-DB layout, profile stats (readonly DB query). `ProfilesScreen` in Settings for managing profiles (create/edit/delete with color picker, switch with app restart confirmation, per-profile collection/item stats). `ProfilePickerScreen` at startup when multiple profiles exist ("Who's playing today?") with "Don't ask again" option. Profile indicator (colored circle with initial) in NavigationRail and BottomBar. Profile-aware database and image cache paths (`database_service.dart`, `image_cache_service.dart`). `AppRestartScope` widget in `main.dart` for seamless profile switching on Android (recreates `ProviderScope` with fresh providers via key change); desktop uses process restart. Sealed `EditProfileResult` for type-safe dialog returns. 18 predefined profile colors. `Profile.hexToColor()` static utility. 30+ localization keys EN+RU (`profile.dart`, `profile_service.dart`, `profile_provider.dart`, `profiles_screen.dart`, `profile_picker_screen.dart`, `create_profile_dialog.dart`, `edit_profile_dialog.dart`, `main.dart`, `navigation_shell.dart`, `settings_screen.dart`, `splash_screen.dart`)
- **Cross-platform gamepad support** — refactored gamepad system from Windows-only to cross-platform (Windows, Linux, Android). `GamepadMapping` abstraction with `WindowsGamepadMapping` (JOYINFOEX), `LinuxGamepadMapping` (/dev/input/js*), `AndroidGamepadMapping`. Normalized stick keys (`stick-left-x/y`, `stick-right-x/y`), trigger key (`trigger`). New `kGamepadSupported` flag enables gamepad on Android handhelds (Odin 2, Steam Deck). Button mapping: LB/RB = main tabs, LT/RT = filters/sub-tabs, D-pad = content navigation, A = confirm, B = back (Esc), Y = context menu (RMB analog). `FocusTraversalGroup` prevents focus from escaping window. Auto-focus on first content item when switching tabs. `CollectionCard` refactored to `InkWell` for native focus support. `onLongPress` added to `CollectionItemTile`, collection grid/list views, and `WishlistTile` for Y button context menu. 35 new tests for mappings (`gamepad_mappings.dart`, `gamepad_service.dart`, `gamepad_listener.dart`, `gamepad_action.dart`, `gamepad_provider.dart`, `platform_features.dart`, `navigation_shell.dart`, `collection_card.dart`, `collection_item_tile.dart`, `collection_items_view.dart`, `wishlist_screen.dart`)
- **Right-click context menus** — desktop right-click (onSecondaryTapUp) shows popup context menu on collection items in all view modes (grid, list, table, reorderable) with Move/Copy/Remove actions, and on collection cards on the home screen (grid + list) with Open/Rename/Delete actions. Mobile long-press behavior unchanged (`collection_items_view.dart`, `collection_item_tile.dart`, `collection_table_view.dart`, `media_poster_card.dart`, `collection_card.dart`, `collection_list_tile.dart`, `home_screen.dart`)
- **Sort control in collection picker dialog** — interactive sort toggle button in the picker dialog header (A→Z / Z→A / date ascending / date descending) with localized labels. Initial sort inherited from home screen settings. Cyclic toggle on click (`collection_picker_dialog.dart`)
- **Copy as Text** — template-based text export of collections to clipboard. Quick "Copy as List" menu item with default template `{name} ({year})`. "Copy as Text…" dialog with editable template, clickable token chips (`{name}`, `{year}`, `{rating}`, `{myRating}`, `{platform}`, `{status}`, `{genres}`, `{notes}`, `{type}`, `{#}`), sort options, and live preview. Smart cleanup removes empty tokens with surrounding delimiters/brackets. Template persisted in SharedPreferences. `TextExportService` with 10 tokens, `CopyAsTextDialog`, 14 localization keys EN+RU (`text_export_service.dart`, `copy_as_text_dialog.dart`, `collection_actions.dart`, `collection_screen.dart`)
- **Keyboard shortcuts for desktop** — full keyboard navigation and hotkeys across all screens. Global shortcuts in `NavigationShell` via `CallbackShortcuts`: Ctrl+1..6 (tab switch), Ctrl+Tab/Shift+Tab (cycle tabs), Escape/Alt+Left (back), Ctrl+F (search), F5 (refresh), F1 (contextual help dialog). Screen-level shortcuts: HomeScreen (Ctrl+N create, Ctrl+I import, Ctrl+Shift+V toggle view, Delete/F2 on focused card), CollectionScreen (Ctrl+N/E/I, Ctrl+Shift+V, Ctrl+B board toggle, Delete/Ctrl+M/Ctrl+Delete/F2), ItemDetailScreen (Ctrl+B/L board/lock toggle, Ctrl+M move, Alt+0..5 rating), TierListsScreen (Ctrl+N create, Delete/F2 on focused card), TierListDetailScreen (Ctrl+E export, Ctrl+Enter add tier, Ctrl+Shift+D clear all), WishlistScreen (Ctrl+N add, Ctrl+H toggle resolved, Ctrl+Shift+D clear resolved), SearchScreen (shortcutGroup for F1). Keyboard focus tracking on `CollectionCard`, `MediaPosterCard`, `_TierListCard` with `onFocusChanged` callbacks. F1 dialog (`KeyboardShortcutsDialog`) shows global + current screen shortcuts with styled key badges. Tooltip hints with shortcut keys on all action buttons (desktop only). New utility module `shortcut_helper.dart` with `wrapWithScreenShortcuts()` and `tooltipWithShortcut()`. Mobile-safe: all shortcuts gated behind `kIsMobile` check (`lib/shared/keyboard/keyboard_shortcuts.dart`, `keyboard_shortcuts_dialog.dart`, `shortcut_helper.dart`, `navigation_shell.dart`, `home_screen.dart`, `collection_screen.dart`, `item_detail_screen.dart`, `tier_lists_screen.dart`, `tier_list_detail_screen.dart`, `wishlist_screen.dart`, `search_screen.dart`, `collection_card.dart`, `collection_items_view.dart`, `media_poster_card.dart`)

## [0.22.0] - 2026-03-19

### Added
- **Separate debug/release database** — debug and profile builds use `tonkatsu_box_dev/` folder, release builds use `tonkatsu_box/` to prevent test data from polluting user collections. Database path and build mode logged at startup (`database_service.dart`)
- **Per-tab Discover sections** — Discover feed now shows only relevant sections per search tab: Movies (Top Rated Movies, Upcoming), TV (Popular TV Shows, Top Rated TV Shows), Anime (Anime). Trending available on all tabs but disabled by default — users enable it via Customize sheet. `discoverSectionsPerSource` mapping, `DiscoverFeed.sourceId`, `DiscoverCustomizeSheet.sourceId` filter sections dynamically (`discover_provider.dart`, `discover_feed.dart`, `discover_customize_sheet.dart`, `search_screen.dart`)
- **Table view for collections** — third view mode alongside grid and list. `CollectionTableView` widget with sortable columns (Name, Type, Platform, Status, Rating, Year) — click headers to toggle ascending/descending sort. Compact rows with poster thumbnails, media type icons, status chips, and star ratings. Hover highlight on desktop, separator lines between rows, styled sticky header with sort indicators. 3-way view toggle button in `CollectionFilterBar`: grid → list → table → grid (icon cycles accordingly). View mode persisted per-collection. 7 new localization keys (EN + RU): `collectionListViewTable`, `collectionTableName`, `collectionTableType`, `collectionTablePlatform`, `collectionTableStatus`, `collectionTableRating`, `collectionTableYear` (`collection_table_view.dart`, `collection_items_view.dart`, `collection_filter_bar.dart`, `collection_screen.dart`, `app_en.arb`, `app_ru.arb`)
- **RetroAchievements import** — new `RaApi` client (`ra_api.dart`) fetches user profile and game completion progress via RetroAchievements Web API (username + API key auth, paginated, rate-limited 1 req/sec). `RaImportService` (`ra_import_service.dart`) orchestrates full import pipeline: fetch RA library + award dates in parallel → match each game to IGDB via `RaToIgdbMapper` → add to collection with platform mapping (RA ConsoleID → IGDB PlatformID, 30+ consoles) → update existing items (status upgrade only, never downgrade) → add unmatched games to Wishlist. Achievement progress saved as user comment (`RA: 12/30 achievements (40%) • beaten-hardcore`). Activity dates (completedAt from awards, lastActivityAt from last played). `RaImportResult` with `toUniversal()` extension for unified `ImportResultScreen`. `RaImportScreen` + `RaImportContent` with credentials input (saved to SharedPreferences), profile preview card (avatar, points, member since, rich presence), collection selector (create new / use existing), IGDB connection warning, live progress with per-game status, navigation to `ImportResultScreen`. Models: `RaGameProgress` (fromJson, completionRate, itemStatus mapping), `RaUserProfile` (fromJson, userPicUrl). Accessible from Settings → Import section. 26 new localization keys (EN + RU) (`ra_api.dart`, `ra_import_service.dart`, `ra_to_igdb_mapper.dart`, `ra_import_screen.dart`, `ra_import_content.dart`, `ra_game_progress.dart`, `ra_user_profile.dart`, `settings_screen.dart`, `settings_provider.dart`, `api_key_initializer.dart`, `app_en.arb`, `app_ru.arb`)
- **IGDB token auto-refresh** — `IgdbApi._igdbPost()` wrapper intercepts HTTP 401, refreshes OAuth token via `getAccessToken(clientId, clientSecret)`, retries request once. `clientSecret` propagated through `ApiKeys` → `IgdbApi.setCredentials()`. `onTokenRefreshed` callback saves new token + expiry to SharedPreferences. On startup, `connectionStatus` set to `connected` when valid token exists (no manual "Verify Connection" needed) (`igdb_api.dart`, `api_key_initializer.dart`, `settings_provider.dart`)

### Changed
- **Update notification moved to navigation** — replaced `UpdateBanner` (content-area banner) with a pulsing badge on the Settings tab icon in both NavigationRail (desktop) and BottomNavigationBar (mobile). Settings screen shows "Update available: vX.Y.Z" tile with link to GitHub releases when update is detected. `UpdateBanner` widget removed (`navigation_shell.dart`, `settings_screen.dart`, `settings_tile.dart`)
- **ApiKeys extended with RA credentials** — `ApiKeys` class now includes `raUsername`, `raApiKey`, `igdbClientSecret` fields. `fromPrefs()` loads RA credentials from SharedPreferences. `clearSettings()` removes RA keys alongside other API credentials (`api_key_initializer.dart`, `settings_provider.dart`)
- **Media type labels on poster cards** — colored media type name (e.g. "Game", "Movie") in card subtitle using `Text.rich` with `MediaTypeTheme.colorFor()`. Order: platform · year · Type (colored) · genre. Visible on all grid/compact `MediaPosterCard` variants across AllItemsScreen, CollectionItemsView, and BrowseGrid (`media_poster_card.dart`)
- **Media type legend** — `MediaTypeLegend` widget with horizontal row of colored dots + localized labels for each `MediaType`. Dismissible via close icon. Shown on AllItemsScreen between filter chips and grid (`media_type_legend.dart`, `all_items_screen.dart`)
- **Spacing and typography constants** — `AppSpacing.gridGap` (16px), `AppSpacing.screenPadding` (20px), `AppTypography.cardTitle` (13px/w600), `AppTypography.cardSubtitle` (11px/w400). Applied to grid padding in AllItemsScreen and CollectionItemsView (`app_spacing.dart`, `app_typography.dart`)
- **Universal import result system** — `UniversalImportResult` model (`universal_import_result.dart`) with per-MediaType breakdown maps (importedByType, wishlistedByType, updatedByType), untyped totals for sources without breakdown, computed getters (totalImported, totalWishlisted, totalUpdated, hasWishlistItems, effectiveCollectionId). `ImportResultScreen` (`import_result_screen.dart`) with celebration header, `_ResultCard` widgets showing per-type breakdown with `MediaTypeTheme` icons/colors, wishlist hint, skipped count, "Open Collection" / "Done" buttons. `toUniversal()` extensions on `SteamImportResult` and `TraktImportResult`. Steam and Trakt importers navigate to `ImportResultScreen` after completion instead of inline result / snackbar. 9 new localization keys (EN + RU). 35 tests (model, extensions, widget)
- **Trakt per-MediaType import tracking** — `TraktImportResult` extended with `importedByType`, `wishlistedByType`, `updatedByType` maps. All import sections (watched movies/shows, ratings, watchlist→collection) now track per-type counts. Result screen shows breakdown by Movie/TV Show/Animation (`trakt_zip_import_service.dart`)
- **Trakt wishlist fallback for watched items** — watched movies and TV shows that fail TMDB fetch (data unavailable) are now added to Wishlist with media type hint instead of being silently skipped. Deduplication via `findUnresolved()` (`trakt_zip_import_service.dart`)
- **Copy item to another collection** — full clone of collection items (status, ratings, comments, progress, activity dates) via "Copy to collection" in context menu on list tiles and detail screens. Canvas and tier-list entries are not copied. Uncategorized hidden from clone target picker. Schema-resilient DAO implementation (`collection_dao.dart`, `collection_repository.dart`, `collections_provider.dart`, `collection_actions.dart`, `collection_item_tile.dart`, `item_detail_screen.dart`)
- **Collection list sorting** — sort collections by date created or alphabetically (A→Z / Z→A) with direction toggle. Sort mode persisted in SharedPreferences. Sort popup button in HomeScreen AppBar with visual indicator when non-default. `CollectionListSortMode` enum, `CollectionListSortNotifier`, `CollectionListSortDescNotifier` (`collection_list_sort_mode.dart`, `collections_provider.dart`, `home_screen.dart`)
- **Collection list grid/list view toggle** — switch between grid (iOS-style folder cards) and list (simple text tiles) view. Preference persisted in SharedPreferences. `CollectionListTile`, `UncategorizedListTile` widgets, `CollectionListViewModeNotifier` (`collection_list_tile.dart`, `collections_provider.dart`, `home_screen.dart`)
- **"Open in collection" button on search cards** — when an item is already in a collection, the check badge on search result cards becomes a clickable button that navigates to `ItemDetailScreen`. If the item is in multiple collections, a picker dialog is shown. Works for all 6 media types (`media_poster_card.dart`, `browse_grid.dart`, `search_screen.dart`)
- **Card shadows instead of borders** — `CardThemeData` updated: `elevation: 0` → `2`, added `shadowColor: Colors.black26`, removed `BorderSide(color: surfaceBorder)`. Cards now use subtle shadow instead of flat border (`app_theme.dart`)

### Fixed
- **API key race condition on first launch** — API requests failed with "API key not set" on first app launch because `SettingsNotifier.build()` set API keys after UI had already started making requests. Added `ApiKeys` class (`api_key_initializer.dart`) that loads keys from SharedPreferences synchronously in `main()` before `runApp()`. API providers (`tmdbApiProvider`, `igdbApiProvider`, `steamGridDbApiProvider`) now read keys from `apiKeysProvider` at creation time. `SettingsNotifier._loadFromPrefs()` no longer sets API keys (they are already set); `_syncApiClients()` added for `importConfig()` re-sync (`api_key_initializer.dart`, `main.dart`, `tmdb_api.dart`, `igdb_api.dart`, `steamgriddb_api.dart`, `settings_provider.dart`)

## [0.21.0] - 2026-03-16

### Added
- **Steam Library import** — new `SteamApi` client (`steam_api.dart`) fetches user's owned games via Steam Web API. `SteamImportService` (`steam_import_service.dart`) orchestrates the full import pipeline: fetch library → filter DLC/soundtracks/demos → match each game to IGDB → add to collection (PC platform, status based on playtime) → add unfound games to wishlist with media type hint. Target collection selector: create new ("Steam Library") or pick existing (Radio + Dropdown, same pattern as Trakt). Duplicates are updated instead of skipped: playtime comment refreshed, `startedAt` date updated, status upgraded only `notStarted` → `inProgress` (never downgrades). Wishlist deduplication: checks for existing unresolved item by name before adding (`WishlistDao.findUnresolvedByText()`). Playtime saved as user comment (`Steam: 2.1h`), last played date as `startedAt`. Rate limiting (4 req/sec) for IGDB. Progress callback with stage/current/total/stats. Invalidates collectionStats, collectionCovers, collectionItems, canvas, allItems, wishlist providers after import (`steam_api.dart`, `steam_import_service.dart`, `steam_import_content.dart`, `wishlist_dao.dart`, `database_service.dart`)
- **File import into existing collection** — `.xcoll/.xcollx` import now supports importing into an existing collection via a target selection dialog ("Create new" / "Add to existing"). Duplicates are updated (authorComment, userRating) instead of silently skipped. Canvas, tier lists, and per-item canvas are skipped when importing into an existing collection to avoid duplication. "Import" menu item added inside collection screen (PopupMenu) for quick import with pre-filled collectionId. `ImportProgressDialog` extracted into shared widget. 7 new localization keys (EN + RU) (`import_service.dart`, `home_screen.dart`, `collection_screen.dart`, `import_progress_dialog.dart`)
- **Steam import UI** — `SteamImportScreen` + `SteamImportContent` with 3 states: input (API key + Steam ID + collection selector with clickable helper links), progress (linear indicator + live stats for imported/wishlisted/updated), result (final counts + "Open collection" button navigating to the target collection). IGDB connection warning when not configured. Accessible from Settings > Import section. 30 localization keys (EN + RU) (`steam_import_screen.dart`, `steam_import_content.dart`, `settings_screen.dart`, `app_en.arb`, `app_ru.arb`)
- **Platform names on game cards in search** — `BrowseGrid` now passes `platformMap` to `MediaPosterCard.platformLabel` for game results. Shows up to 3 platform abbreviations with "+N" overflow (e.g. "PC, PS4, XONE +1"). Platform data loaded from `SearchScreen._platformMap` (`browse_grid.dart`, `search_screen.dart`)
- **Platform names on tier list game cards** — `TierItemCard` shows platform abbreviation below the item name for games with an assigned platform. Displayed in both the interactive tier list view and PNG export (`tier_item_card.dart`)
- **Commit convention guide** — `docs/COMMITS.md` with Conventional Commits format, type table, scope examples, branch naming rules. `CONTRIBUTING.md` updated with link to the new guide (`COMMITS.md`, `CONTRIBUTING.md`)
- **Steam test infrastructure** — `MockSteamApi`, `MockSteamImportService` in `mocks.dart`, `createTestSteamOwnedGame` builder in `builders.dart`. 25 tests for `SteamApi` (parsing, errors, shouldSkip), 21 tests for `SteamImportService` (import flow, statuses, duplicate update, wishlist dedup, progress, exact match)

### Changed
- **Platform filter shows abbreviations** — platform names in search filter now display as "Name (ABBR)" (e.g. "Nintendo Entertainment System (NES)"). Search matches both full name and abbreviation. Applies to both the filter sheet and filter dropdown (`platform_filter_sheet.dart`, `igdb_platform_filter.dart`)
- **`BrowseNotifier.setSearchQuery()`** — new method to update `searchQuery` in state without triggering `_fetch()`. Used by `FilterBar.onBeforeFilterChange` callback to sync pending search text before filter application (`browse_provider.dart`)
- **`FilterBar.onBeforeFilterChange`** — new optional `VoidCallback` parameter, invoked before `setFilter()`. `SearchScreen` passes `_syncSearchText` to preserve typed-but-unsubmitted search text when user changes a filter (`filter_bar.dart`, `search_screen.dart`)

### Fixed
- **Activity dates missing year** — date chips on detail screens and episode watched dates showed "Jan 15" without year. Now displays "Jan 15, 2025" (`media_detail_view.dart`, `episode_tracker_section.dart`)
- **Trakt import stale data after import** — re-importing from Trakt created duplicate wishlist entries and collection items/canvas/stats did not refresh until app restart. Now checks `findUnresolved()` before adding to wishlist. Full provider invalidation: `collectionStatsProvider`, `collectionCoversProvider`, `collectionItemsNotifierProvider`, `canvasNotifierProvider`, `wishlistProvider` refresh after import. Radio button ListTiles respond to text tap (`trakt_import_content.dart`, `trakt_zip_import_service.dart`, `wishlist_repository.dart`)
- **Search text lost when changing filters** — when user typed a search query without pressing Enter and then changed a filter (e.g. platform), the search text was only in the `TextEditingController` but not in `BrowseState.searchQuery`, so `_fetch()` ran without the query. Now `FilterBar` syncs the controller text into the provider before applying the filter (`browse_provider.dart`, `filter_bar.dart`, `search_screen.dart`)

## [0.20.0] - 2026-03-12

### Added
- **Tier list item labels** — `TierItemCard` now shows a black label bar under each cover with the full item name (white text, no truncation). Dynamic height via `IntrinsicHeight` in `TierRow` and `_ExportTierRow`. Export PNG also includes labels (`tier_item_card.dart`, `tier_row.dart`, `tier_list_export_view.dart`)
- **Create tier list dialog validation** — empty name and unselected collection now show inline error messages. Added `tierListErrorEmptyName` and `tierListErrorNoCollection` localization keys (EN + RU) (`create_tier_list_dialog.dart`, `app_en.arb`, `app_ru.arb`)
- **Tier list type-to-filter** — `TypeToFilterOverlay` on tier list detail screen filters Unranked pool by item name (desktop keyboard input). `TierListView` accepts `filterQuery` parameter with case-insensitive matching (`tier_list_detail_screen.dart`, `tier_list_view.dart`)
- **Gamepad Debug available in all environments** — `GamepadDebugScreen` accessible from Settings in release builds (not just debug mode). Added "Export log to file" button that saves raw + service events to a `.txt` file via FilePicker (desktop) or Documents directory (Android). Responsive layout: vertical stacking on narrow screens (<600px) (`gamepad_debug_screen.dart`, `settings_screen.dart`)
- **Tier list cleanup on item removal/move** — `TierListDao.removeItemFromCollectionTierLists()` and `getTierListIdsForItem()` methods. `CollectionsNotifier.removeItem()` and `moveItem()` now invalidate affected tier list detail providers (`tier_list_dao.dart`, `collections_provider.dart`)
- **Collection picker duplicate detection** — `showCollectionPickerDialog` now accepts `alreadyInCollectionIds` parameter. Collections where the item already exists are shown as disabled with a "✓ Added" badge, sorted to the bottom. Footer displays "Already in N collection(s)" counter. Uncategorized follows the same rules — disabled when `null` is in the set. All 7 `_add*ToAnyCollection` methods in `SearchScreen`, 2 recommendation methods in `ItemDetailScreen` compute and pass `alreadyInCollectionIds` (`collection_picker_dialog.dart`, `search_screen.dart`, `item_detail_screen.dart`)
- **Cross-type duplicate detection** — `_addMovieToAnyCollection` and `_addTvShowToAnyCollection` now check both their own provider and `collectedAnimationIdsProvider`. Likewise, animation methods check movie/tvShow providers. Ensures the picker highlights collections regardless of the media type the item was added as (`search_screen.dart`, `item_detail_screen.dart`)
- **Collection picker search filter** — text filter field shown when there are ≥5 collections, with clear button. Client-side name matching (`collection_picker_dialog.dart`)
- **Collection picker visual redesign** — replaced `AlertDialog` with `Dialog` + `_CollectionPickerContent` StatefulWidget. Colored icon squares (brand/tertiary), constrained size (400×500), divider footer with counter and Cancel (`collection_picker_dialog.dart`)
- **New localization keys** — `collectionPickerFilter`, `collectionPickerAlreadyAdded`, `collectionPickerAlreadyInCount` in EN and RU with ICU plurals (`app_en.arb`, `app_ru.arb`)

### Changed
- **Tier list card size increase** — cover dimensions 60×82 → 90×120, label width 60 → 70 in tier row and export row (`tier_item_card.dart`, `tier_row.dart`, `tier_list_export_view.dart`)
- **Create tier list dialog desktop UX** — wider dialog (520px on ≥800px screens), larger padding, bigger font, radio buttons selectable by text label tap, Create button is now `FilledButton` (`create_tier_list_dialog.dart`)
- **Priority rating sort** — `CollectionSortMode.rating` now uses `userRating` first, falls back to `apiRating`; items with no rating pushed to end/beginning based on direction (`sort_utils.dart`)
- **`_CanvasTimerMixin` refactoring** — extracted `moveItem()`, `updateViewport()`, `resetViewport()` and timer fields from `CanvasNotifier` and `GameCanvasNotifier` into a shared `_CanvasTimerMixin`. Each notifier implements `_persistViewport()` and `_viewportId`. Eliminates ~90 lines of duplicated code (`canvas_provider.dart`)

### Fixed
- **NavigationRail overflow** — wrapped rail in `LayoutBuilder`; switches to `labelType: selected` when height < 480px to prevent 11px bottom overflow (`navigation_shell.dart`)
- **Tier list ghost items** — items deleted from or moved between collections no longer remain on the old collection's tier list. Entries cleaned up via `removeItemFromCollectionTierLists()` and provider invalidation (`collections_provider.dart`, `tier_list_dao.dart`)
- **Markdown toolbar link dialog overflow** — wrapped `Column` content in `SingleChildScrollView` to prevent RenderFlex overflow on small screens (`markdown_toolbar.dart`)
- **Searchable filter dialogs** — `SearchFilter.searchable` property enables a search dialog (with text filter field) instead of plain `PopupMenuButton` for filters with many options. Enabled for `IgdbGenreFilter` and `IgdbPlatformFilter` (`filter_dropdown.dart`, `search_source.dart`)
- **Multi-select platform filter** — `SearchFilter.multiSelect` property enables checkbox-based multi-selection. `IgdbPlatformFilter` supports selecting multiple platforms simultaneously. Dialog shows checkboxes, "Apply (N)" / "Reset" buttons, selected items pinned to top (`filter_dropdown.dart`, `igdb_platform_filter.dart`)
- **`_SearchableFilterDialog` widget** — reusable dialog with text search field, single-select (tap to choose) and multi-select (checkboxes + confirm) modes. Selected items sorted to top on open (`filter_dropdown.dart`)
- **Global error handlers** — `AppLogger.setupErrorHandlers()` captures `FlutterError.onError` and `PlatformDispatcher.onError`. `main()` wrapped in `runZonedGuarded` for unhandled zone errors. All exceptions logged with full stack traces via `dart:developer` (`app_logger.dart`, `main.dart`)
- **TTL eviction for movie/tvShow/episode caches** — `MovieDao.clearStaleMovies()`, `TvShowDao.clearStaleTvShows()`, `TvShowDao.clearStaleEpisodes()` delete entries older than 30 days not linked to a collection. Runs automatically at startup in `SplashScreen` via `Future.wait` (`movie_dao.dart`, `tv_show_dao.dart`, `splash_screen.dart`)

### Fixed
- **Collection card mosaic** — cover images no longer stretched/cropped. Changed `BoxFit.cover` → `BoxFit.contain` to preserve original aspect ratio, removed `memCacheHeight` (was forcing square decode), added black border outline around each cover. Grid layout changed to 3+3 (was 3+2) with 6 covers (`collection_card.dart`, `collection_covers_provider.dart`)

### Changed
- **`CollectionDao._loadJoinedData()`** — 6 sequential `await` calls replaced with `Future.wait()` for parallel execution. All queries are independent (different tables), `_resolveGenresIfNeeded` still runs after (`collection_dao.dart`)
- **Collection default view mode** — changed from list to grid (card view) for new collections (`collection_screen.dart`)

### Removed
- **`ItemStatus.displayLabel()`** — dead code removed. Only `localizedLabel()` (l10n-aware) remains (`item_status.dart`)

### Changed
- **`IgdbApi.browseGames()`** — parameter `platformId: int?` changed to `platformIds: List<int>?` for multi-platform filtering (`igdb_api.dart`)
- **`IgdbGamesSource.fetch()`** — platform filter value parsing supports both `List<Object>` (multi-select) and `int` (single) via pattern matching (`igdb_games_source.dart`)
- **`BrowseState.hasFilters`** — now correctly treats empty `List<Object>` as inactive filter (`browse_provider.dart`)
- **`BottomNavigationBar`** — hidden labels on mobile (`showSelectedLabels: false`, `showUnselectedLabels: false`) to prevent overflow with 6 tabs (`navigation_shell.dart`)

### Added
- **Tier Lists feature** — full-featured tier list system for ranking collection items. Create global tier lists (all items) or scoped to a specific collection. Drag-and-drop items between tiers (S/A/B/C + custom). Customizable tier labels and colors via color picker (12 presets). Export tier list as PNG image (RepaintBoundary capture with "made by Tonkatsu Box" branding). New navigation tab with `Icons.leaderboard`
- **Tier Lists models** — `TierList` (id, name, collectionId, isGlobal), `TierDefinition` (tierKey, label, color, sortOrder with static S/A/B/C defaults), `TierListEntry` (collectionItemId, tierKey, sortOrder). All models with `fromDb`/`toDb`/`copyWith`/`toExport`/`fromExport`
- **Tier Lists database** — 3 new SQLite tables (`tier_lists`, `tier_definitions`, `tier_list_entries`) via migration v26. `TierListDao` with full CRUD, reorder, and batch operations
- **Tier Lists providers** — `TierListsNotifier` (AsyncNotifier for list management with optimistic updates) and `TierListDetailNotifier` (FamilyNotifier for single tier list state: definitions, entries, items, drag-and-drop operations)
- **Tier Lists .xcollx export/import** — tier lists included in full export with `itemIdMapping` pattern (`media_type:external_id` → new item ID) for cross-collection entry resolution on import
- **Tier Lists from collection screen** — `IconButton(Icons.leaderboard)` in collection AppBar opens filtered tier lists for that collection. Popup menu action to create a scoped tier list with auto-navigation to detail screen
- **Collection tier lists provider** — `collectionTierListsProvider` (FamilyAsyncNotifier) loads tier lists filtered by `collectionId` via `TierListDao.getTierListsByCollection()`. Create/rename/delete invalidate global `tierListsProvider`
- **Tier Lists localization** — 21 new keys in EN and RU (navTierLists, tierListCreate, tierListUnranked, tierListExportImage, etc.)
- **Tier Lists tests** — 99 new tests: models (29), DAO (17), providers (79), widgets (20)

### Changed
- **Default tier definitions** — reduced from 6 (S/A/B/C/D/F) to 4 (S/A/B/C). Users can still add custom tiers via the "+" button
- **TierListsScreen** — added optional `collectionId` parameter. When set, shows only tier lists for that collection and creates new ones scoped to it
- **CreateTierListDialog** — `_submit` validates that a collection is selected when scope is "From collection". Uses `collectionTierListsProvider` for collection-scoped creation
- **Landing page (docs/index.html)** — added Tier Lists feature card, meta keywords (`tier list maker, tier list generator`), updated hero subtitle and JSON-LD description

## [0.19.0] - 2026-03-10

### Added
- **MiniMarkdownText widget** — inline rich text renderer supporting bold (`**`), italic (`*`), links (`[text](url)`), and bare URLs. Tappable links open in system browser via `url_launcher`. Used in detail screen comments and wishlist notes
- **MarkdownToolbar widget** — reusable toolbar with Bold/Italic/Link buttons for markdown editing. Static `wrapSelection()` wraps selected text in markers, `insertLink()` opens a dialog for `[text](url)` insertion. Used in `MediaDetailView` (comments/reviews) and `AddWishlistDialog` (notes)
- **Wishlist markdown support** — note field in Add/Edit Wishlist dialog now has `MarkdownToolbar` and renders notes via `MiniMarkdownText` on the wishlist screen

### Changed
- **MediaPosterCard grid layout** — fixed-height text block (`SizedBox` 52px / 38px compact) ensures uniform card height across the grid. Title now shows up to 2 lines (was 1). Subtitle always rendered (empty string preserves space). `Tooltip` wraps text block for full title on hover/long press
- **MediaPosterCard hover dimming** — idle posters are dimmed ~25% (`Color.fromARGB(0x40, 0, 0, 0)`), dimming smoothly fades to transparent on hover via `AnimatedBuilder` linked to `_hoverController`. Scale 1.04x on hover preserved
- **MiniMarkdownText link regex** — removed `https?://` requirement from `[text](url)` pattern, allowing arbitrary URLs like `[guide](topper)`
- **MediaDetailView** — extracted inline markdown toolbar code into shared `MarkdownToolbar` widget (−100 lines)

## [0.18.1] - 2026-03-06

### Added
- **Built-in IGDB Key** — IGDB now supports built-in API keys via `--dart-define` (same pattern as TMDB and SteamGridDB). Users can search games immediately after install without registering a Twitch developer app. Auto-verifies OAuth token on startup when credentials are available. Credentials UI shows "Using built-in key" status with Reset button. Welcome Wizard displays "BUILT-IN KEY" badge for all APIs that have embedded keys. Release workflow updated with `IGDB_CLIENT_ID` and `IGDB_CLIENT_SECRET` dart-defines for all 3 platforms. 13 new tests

## [0.18.0] - 2026-03-06

### Changed
- **Settings UX — Subtitles & Reorder** — added optional `subtitle` parameter to `SettingsGroup` (shown below uppercase title) and `SettingsTile` (shown below main text). Reordered settings sections: Profile moved from 5th to 1st position. Added 12 new localization keys (EN + RU) for section and tile subtitles, updated 3 existing subtitle values for clarity. 5 new tests for subtitle rendering

### Added
- **Completion Time Display** — shows time taken to complete collection items when both started and completed dates are set. Added `CollectionItem.completionTime` getter that returns `Duration?` from date difference (null for missing dates or negative durations). `ActivityDatesSection` displays completion time with localized formatting ("2 weeks", "3 months", "1.1 years"). `MediaDetailView` includes completion time in horizontal dates row. Shared `lib/shared/utils/duration_formatter.dart` utility with `formatDuration()` and `formatCompletionTime()` functions, supporting 6 time ranges with smart rounding. 7 localization keys (EN + RU): `activityDatesCompletionTime`, `durationLessThanDay`, `durationOneDay`, `durationDays`, `durationWeeks`, `durationMonths`, `durationYears`. 26 new tests: 5 for `CollectionItem.completionTime` logic, 18 for `ActivityDatesSection` widget, 3 for `MediaDetailView` integration
- **Welcome Wizard — Name & Language steps** — expanded Welcome Wizard from 4 to 6 steps. New step 2 (`WelcomeStepName`) lets the user set their author name via a `TextField` backed by `SettingsNotifier.setDefaultAuthor()`. New step 3 (`WelcomeStepLanguage`) offers English/Russian selection via animated cards backed by `SettingsNotifier.setAppLanguage()`. 8 new localization keys (EN + RU). 18 new tests for both widgets, plus updated `welcome_screen_test.dart` for 6-step flow
- **AniList Manga Integration** — manga as 6th media type via AniList GraphQL API. `AniListApi` client (`anilist_api.dart`) with search, browse (genre/format filters, 4 sort modes), batch `getMangaByIds()` with pagination (50 per batch). `Manga` model with 22 fields, computed properties (`rating10`, `formatLabel`, `statusLabel`, `progressString`), `fromJson`/`fromDb`/`toDb`/`toExport`/`copyWith`. `AniListMangaSource` — pluggable search source with `AniListGenreFilter` (20 genres) and `MangaFormatFilter` (6 formats). `MangaDetailsSheet` — bottom sheet with cover, metadata, genres, description, "Add to Collection" button. `MangaProgressSection` — reading progress widget with chapter/volume progress bars, +1 increment buttons, edit dialog, "Mark as completed". Auto-status transitions for manga reading progress (`_autoUpdateMangaStatus`): notStarted/planned→inProgress on first chapter/volume, →completed when chapters reach total, →notStarted on full reset, completed→inProgress on decrease; `dropped` status is never overwritten. DB migration v25 (`manga_cache` table), `MangaDao` for CRUD operations. Full propagation across `MediaType.manga`, `CanvasItemType.manga`, `CollectionItem.manga`, canvas repository, collection covers, export/import, all_items filter chip, collection filter bar, browse grid with in-collection markers, wishlist→search navigation. 18 localization keys (EN + RU). 53 new tests
- **AniList Attribution** — AniList card added to Credits screen (`_TextLogoProviderCard` with brand blue `#3DB4F2`), `creditsAniListAttribution` localization key (EN + RU), README updated in 7 places (description, features, API setup, credits, tech stack)
- **DAO layer** — extracted 7 domain-specific DAO classes from `DatabaseService` into `lib/core/database/dao/`: `GameDao`, `MovieDao`, `TvShowDao`, `VisualNovelDao`, `CollectionDao`, `CanvasDao`, `WishlistDao`. Each DAO receives a database accessor function and encapsulates all SQL operations for its domain
- `CanvasDao.insertCanvasItemsBatch()` and `deleteCanvasItemsBatch()` — batch INSERT/DELETE using `Transaction` + `Batch` for canvas items. Eliminates N individual DB calls when opening/syncing large canvases
- `CanvasRepository.createItemsBatch()` and `deleteItemsBatch()` — repository-level batch operations wrapping DAO batch methods
- Tests for all 7 DAOs (166 tests): `game_dao_test.dart`, `movie_dao_test.dart`, `tv_show_dao_test.dart`, `visual_novel_dao_test.dart`, `collection_dao_test.dart`, `canvas_dao_test.dart`, `wishlist_dao_test.dart`
- `TransactionMockDatabase` in `test/helpers/mocks.dart` — solves mocktail limitation with generic `Database.transaction<T>()` method stubbing

### Changed
- **Create Collection Dialog** — removed author field from `CreateCollectionDialog`, author is now taken automatically from Settings (`authorName`). Deleted `CreateCollectionResult` class. Dialog returns `String?` (name only). Removed 3 orphan localization keys (`createCollectionAuthor`, `createCollectionAuthorHint`, `createCollectionEnterAuthor`)
- **Settings Unified Layout** — removed desktop sidebar layout (`SettingsSidebar`), all platforms now use a single iOS-style grouped-list with `SettingsGroup`/`SettingsTile`. Deleted 4 legacy widgets: `SettingsSidebar`, `SettingsSection`, `SettingsRow`, `SettingsNavRow` (−334 lines). All 7 screen wrappers unified: `Align(topCenter)` + `ConstrainedBox(600)` + consistent `EdgeInsets.symmetric` padding
- **Credits Screen** — replaced SVG logo cards (`_ProviderCard`, `_TextLogoProviderCard`, `_OpenSourceCard`) with plain-text `SettingsGroup` entries. Removed `flutter_svg` and `source_badge` dependencies from credits
- **Trakt Import Screen** — merged separate instructions and file picker sections into a single `SettingsGroup`
- **Debug Hub Screen** — migrated from `SettingsSection`/`SettingsNavRow` to `SettingsGroup`/`SettingsTile`
- `SearchScreen` — added `initialSourceId` parameter replacing legacy `initialTabIndex` for precise source pre-selection from Wishlist
- Recommendations section on detail screens — changed from blacklist to whitelist (only movies, TV shows, animation)
- `DataSource.anilist` color set to AniList brand blue `Color(0xFF3DB4F2)`
- `CollectionDao.getCollectionCovers()` — added `LEFT JOIN manga_cache` for manga cover thumbnails
- `DatabaseService` refactored from ~2700 lines to ~850 lines — now delegates all operations to DAO instances via `late final` fields, preserving the existing public API
- `CanvasRepository.initializeCanvas()` — replaced N individual `createItem()` calls with single `createItemsBatch()` transaction
- `CanvasNotifier._syncCanvasWithItems()` — replaced individual `deleteItem()`/`createItem()` loops with `deleteItemsBatch()`/`createItemsBatch()` batch calls. Fixes "database has been locked for 10s" warnings on large collections
- `CollectionDao.reorderItems()` — replaced N sequential `txn.update()` calls with `Batch.update()` in a single transaction
- `CollectionItemsNotifier` — replaced `ref.read()` in action methods with instance fields set during `build()` to fix Riverpod assertion error when watched dependencies change asynchronously
- `docs/CODESTYLE.md` — fixed builder names to match actual functions, updated migration procedure example

### Fixed
- Fixed search text field clear button not appearing/disappearing reactively — added `TextEditingController.addListener` for immediate rebuild
- Fixed search text auto-deleting on input — replaced `!hasSearchQuery` sync in `build()` with source-change-only clear via `_lastSourceId` tracking
- Fixed wishlist→search navigation opening wrong source for all non-game types
- Fixed detail sheet cover images not loading on Windows desktop — replaced `CachedNetworkImage` (unreliable `flutter_cache_manager` HTTP cache) with project's `CachedImage` widget (file-based `ImageCacheService`) in `GameDetailsSheet`, `MangaDetailsSheet`, `VnDetailsSheet`, `MediaDetailsSheet`, and `DiscoverRow`. Added `cacheImageType`/`cacheImageId` optional params to `MediaDetailsSheet` for correct per-media-type caching. Updated callers in `SearchScreen` and `DiscoverFeed`
- Fixed manga card tap not opening details or adding to collection
- Fixed collection covers not showing for manga items
- Fixed "database has been locked for 10s" warnings when opening canvas for collections with many items — batch DB operations reduce N individual INSERT/DELETE calls to single transactions
- Fixed Riverpod `_didChangeDependency` assertion crash in `CollectionItemsNotifier.refresh()` when sort providers update asynchronously from SharedPreferences
- Fixed RenderFlex overflow in Welcome Wizard on small screens — added adaptive layout with `LayoutBuilder` to `WelcomeStepName`, `WelcomeStepLanguage`, and `WelcomeStepReady`. Applied `SingleChildScrollView` with responsive sizing for icons, text, spacing, and buttons based on screen height constraints. Prevents 73px/113px overflow on constrained displays

## [0.17.0] - 2026-03-03

### Added
- **[Experimental]** Type-to-Filter overlay (desktop only) — typing on physical keyboard shows a floating search bar that filters loaded items by title in real-time. Works on 5 screens: AllItems, HomeScreen, CollectionScreen, SearchScreen, WishlistScreen. Widget `TypeToFilterOverlay` (`type_to_filter_overlay.dart`), keys: printable characters — show/filter, Escape — hide, Backspace — delete character, close button. Zero overhead on mobile
- `sortDisabledTooltip` localization key (EN + RU) — tooltip for disabled sort dropdown during text search
- Tests: `type_to_filter_overlay_test.dart` (12 tests), `filter_dropdown_test.dart` (3 tests), updated `browse_provider_test.dart`, `search_source_test.dart`

- `static final Logger _log` field in 11 core classes: `IgdbApi`, `TmdbApi`, `SteamGridDbApi`, `VndbApi`, `DatabaseService`, `ImageCacheService`, `ImportService`, `ExportService`, `TraktZipImportService`, `ConfigService`, `UpdateService`
- Logging in `DatabaseService._onCreate()` and `_onUpgrade()` — schema creation and migration progress messages
- `dart-tonkatsu` coding standards skill (`.claude/skills/dart-tonkatsu/SKILL.md`) — project-wide Dart/Flutter conventions including logging rules, catch-block policy, import ordering, model structure
- iOS folder-style `CollectionCard` widget (`collection_card.dart`) — 3+3 mosaic grid (3 posters top row, 2 posters + "+N" counter bottom row), hover dimming effect with `AnimationController`, rounded corners (16px outer, 8px cells), internal padding 14px

### Changed
- Unified Search — replaced separate `browse()` and `search()` methods in `SearchSource` with single `fetch(query?, filterValues, sortBy, page)`. Text search and filters now work simultaneously on all 5 tabs. `BrowseState` removed `isSearchMode`, added `hasSearchQuery`/`hasActiveQuery`. SearchScreen shows FilterBar + SearchField simultaneously (no AnimatedSwitcher toggle)
- IGDB `searchGames` now supports `genreId`, `year`, `decade` filter parameters during text search
- TMDB `searchMoviesPaged`/`searchTvShowsPaged` now support `year` parameter during text search
- VNDB `browseVn` now accepts `query` for native search+tag combination
- Sort dropdown (`FilterDropdown`) disabled with tooltip hint when text search is active on sources that don't support custom sort (TMDB, IGDB). VNDB supports sort during search and remains enabled. Controlled via `SearchSource.supportsSortDuringSearch`
- `BrowseGrid` accepts optional `clientFilter` parameter for Type-to-Filter client-side filtering by title
- Genre/tag/platform providers now read static data from SQLite (seeded by migration v24) instead of fetching from APIs at runtime. Affected: `genre_provider.dart`, `igdb_genre_provider.dart`, `vndb_tag_provider.dart`
- `genre_provider.dart` — `movieGenresProvider`/`tvGenresProvider` derive from `movieGenreMapProvider`/`tvGenreMapProvider` (no duplicate DB queries). Language-aware: reads `lang` column based on TMDB language setting
- `Platform` model simplified — removed `logoImageId`, `syncedAt`, `logoUrl` fields
- `DatabaseService.getTmdbGenreMap()` — added `lang` parameter for bilingual genre lookup
- `DatabaseService._onCreate()` — calls `MigrationV24().migrate(db)` for fresh install seeding
- `DatabaseService.clearAllData()` — no longer deletes static reference tables (platforms, tmdb_genres, igdb_genres, vndb_tags)
- `SettingsNotifier` — removed `syncPlatforms()`, `_preloadTmdbGenres()`, `lastSync` from state. `setTmdbLanguage()` no longer clears/reloads genre cache
- `CredentialsContent` — removed platform sync button, logo download logic, last sync display. Changed label from "Platforms synced" to "Platforms available"
- IGDB API queries — removed `platform_logo.image_id` from `fetchPlatforms` and `fetchPlatformsByIds`
- Replaced 5 silent `catch (_)` blocks with `catch (e)` + `_log.warning(...)` in `TmdbApi` (genre map loading), `ImageCacheService` (save bytes, download), `ImportService` (base64 restore), `ExportService` (export failure)
- Replaced `debugPrint()` with `_log.warning()` in `ImportService` (VNDB fetch error)
- Replaced `print()` with `_log.fine()` in `GamepadDebugScreen` (raw gamepad events)
- Replaced `import 'package:flutter/foundation.dart'` with `import 'dart:typed_data'` in `ImportService` (only `Uint8List` was needed)
- `HomeScreen` — replaced category-grouped layout with single `GridView.builder` using `SliverGridDelegateWithMaxCrossAxisExtent(maxCrossAxisExtent: 273, childAspectRatio: 1)`. All collections rendered as `CollectionCard` widgets
- `CollectionScreen` — major refactoring: extracted filter bar, items view, canvas layout, and action helpers into separate widgets. Reduced from ~1800 lines to ~500 lines

### Fixed
- `collectionCoversProvider` now invalidated in all 6 mutation points in `CollectionItemsNotifier` (`refresh`, `delete`, `moveItem`, `updateItemStatus`, `updateActivityDates`) — cover mosaics on HomeScreen update when items are added, removed, or moved
- `DatabaseService.getCollectionCovers()` SQL — wrapped in subquery to avoid referencing column alias `thumbnail_url` in WHERE clause (not reliably supported across SQLite versions)
- `BrowseGrid` viewport fill auto-load — on tall/wide screens where initial results (20 items) fit entirely without scrollbar, `loadMore()` was never called. Added `_scheduleViewportFillCheck()` with `addPostFrameCallback` and `ref.listen` to auto-load more pages until viewport is filled or results exhausted

### Removed
- `DatabaseService.cacheIgdbGenres()`, `cacheTmdbGenres()`, `clearTmdbGenres()`, `cacheVndbTags()`, `clearPlatforms()` — replaced by static seeding in migration v24
- `SettingsNotifier.syncPlatforms()`, `_preloadTmdbGenres()` — no longer needed with static data
- `SettingsState.lastSync` field — sync timestamp removed from state

- `Platform.logoImageId`, `Platform.syncedAt`, `Platform.logoUrl` — platform logo fields removed
- `_buildPlatformLogo()` methods in `search_screen.dart` and `platform_filter_sheet.dart` — replaced with static icons
- `_formatTimestamp()` and `_downloadLogosIfEnabled()` in `credentials_content.dart`
- `CollectionTile` widget (`collection_tile.dart`) and its tests — replaced by `CollectionCard`
- `HeroCollectionCard` widget (`hero_collection_card.dart`) and its tests — replaced by `CollectionCard`

## [0.16.0] - 2026-02-28

### Added
- Visual Novel support via VNDB API — 5th media type (`MediaType.visualNovel`). New model `VisualNovel` (`visual_novel.dart`) with `fromJson`/`fromDb`/`toDb`/`toExport`/`copyWith`, computed getters (rating10, numericId, releaseYear, lengthLabel, platformsString). `VndbTag` for genre tags
- VNDB API client (`vndb_api.dart`) — public API (no auth, ~200 req/min). Methods: `searchVn()`, `browseVn()`, `getVnById()`, `getVnByIds()`, `fetchTags()`. Custom `VndbApiException` with rate limit handling
- `VndbSource` search source (`vndb_source.dart`) — pluggable source for Browse/Search with tag-based genre filter and 3 sort options (rating, released, votecount)
- `VndbTagFilter` (`vndb_tag_filter.dart`) — async tag loading from VNDB API via `vndbTagsProvider` with DB cache

- Tests: `visual_novel_test.dart` (42 tests), `vndb_api_test.dart` (20 tests). Updated existing tests for 5th media type

### Changed
- `MediaType` enum extended with `visualNovel` value — all exhaustive switches updated (`collection_screen`, `item_detail_screen`, `all_items_screen`, `canvas_item`, `hero_collection_card`)
- `CollectionItem` extended with `VisualNovel? visualNovel` field and `_resolvedMedia` case for visual novels

- Search refactoring — pluggable source architecture with `SearchSource` / `SearchFilter` abstractions (`search_source.dart`). Four sources: `TmdbMoviesSource`, `TmdbTvSource`, `TmdbAnimeSource`, `IgdbGamesSource` (`lib/features/search/sources/`). Five filter types: `TmdbGenreFilter`, `IgdbGenreFilter`, `YearFilter`, `IgdbPlatformFilter`, `AnimeTypeFilter` (`lib/features/search/filters/`)
- Browse/Search mode — unified `BrowseNotifier` (`browse_provider.dart`) manages source switching, filter state, pagination, and search vs browse mode. Source dropdown + filter bar + sort dropdown in horizontal `FilterBar` (`filter_bar.dart`). Grid results in `BrowseGrid` (`browse_grid.dart`)
- `IgdbApi.browseGames()` — discover games with genre/platform filters and sort options (`igdb_api.dart`)
- `IgdbApi.getGenres()` — fetch all IGDB genres; `igdbGenresProvider` caches genre list (`igdb_genre_provider.dart`)
- `TmdbApi` decade-based year filtering — `discoverMoviesFiltered()` and `discoverTvShowsFiltered()` accept `yearDecadeStart`/`yearDecadeEnd` for grouped year ranges (`tmdb_api.dart`)
- `SearchFilter.cacheKey` — disambiguates filters with the same `key` but different option sets. `TmdbGenreFilter` → `genre_movie`/`genre_tv`, `IgdbGenreFilter` → `genre_igdb` (`search_source.dart`, `tmdb_genre_filter.dart`, `igdb_genre_filter.dart`)
- "In collection" markers in Browse grid — `_collectedIdsProvider` aggregates collected TMDB/IGDB IDs across all collections, `BrowseGrid._buildCard()` passes `isInCollection: true` to `MediaPosterCard` for green checkmark badge (`browse_grid.dart`)
- `SourceDropdown` widget — dropdown to switch between search sources with icons and labels (`source_dropdown.dart`)
- `FilterDropdown` widget — generic popup menu dropdown for search filters with async option loading and generation-based cancellation (`filter_dropdown.dart`)

- Tests: 50+ new tests for search sources, filters (cacheKey coverage), browse_provider, browse_grid (isInCollection, grid delegate variants), filter_bar, filter_dropdown, source_dropdown

### Changed
- `SearchScreen` rewritten from 4-tab TabBarView to unified Browse/Search architecture — single source dropdown replaces TabBar, filters replace bottom sheets, BrowseGrid replaces per-tab grids (`search_screen.dart`)
- `BrowseGrid` grid delegate now matches `CollectionScreen` — desktop (≥800px): `SliverGridDelegateWithMaxCrossAxisExtent(maxCrossAxisExtent: 150, childAspectRatio: 0.55)`, mobile/tablet: `SliverGridDelegateWithFixedCrossAxisCount(childAspectRatio: 0.55)` (`browse_grid.dart`)
- `FilterDropdown.didUpdateWidget()` now compares `filter.cacheKey` instead of `filter.key` to correctly reload options when switching between movie/tv/game genre filters (`filter_dropdown.dart`)
- `FilterBar` now applies `ValueKey('${source.id}_${filter.cacheKey}')` to each `FilterDropdown` — forces Flutter to recreate the widget when source changes (`filter_bar.dart`)
- `DiscoverProvider` extracted discover section IDs and settings into standalone providers for reuse across Browse/Search modes (`discover_provider.dart`)
- `DatabaseService.upsertGame()` improved null-safe merge logic for existing game records (`database_service.dart`)

### Fixed
- Games added via Browse/Search now persist data before collection insert — added `upsertGame()` call in `_addGameToCollection()` and `_addGameToAnyCollection()`, preventing "Unknown Game" entries in collections (`search_screen.dart`)

### Removed
- Removed `GameSearchNotifier`, `MediaSearchNotifier`, `SortSelector`, `PlatformFilterSheet`, `MediaFilterSheet` — replaced by `BrowseNotifier` and pluggable source/filter architecture

- "External Rating" sort mode (`CollectionSortMode.externalRating`) — sorts collection items by IGDB/TMDB API rating (`apiRating`, normalized 0–10), highest first, unrated items at the end. Localized in EN and RU (`collection_sort_mode.dart`, `sort_utils.dart`, `app_en.arb`, `app_ru.arb`)
- Tests: `externalRating` coverage in `collection_sort_mode_test.dart` (6 new tests) and `sort_utils_test.dart` (6 new tests)
- `externalUrl` field on `Game`, `Movie`, `TvShow` models — stores the IGDB/TMDB page URL. `Game.fromJson()` reads `url` from IGDB API; `Movie.fromJson()` / `TvShow.fromJson()` construct `https://www.themoviedb.org/{movie|tv}/{id}`. Included in `toDb()`, `fromDb()`, `copyWith()`, `toJson()` (Game). Persisted in SQLite (`external_url TEXT` column), exported in `.xcollx` (`game.dart`, `movie.dart`, `tv_show.dart`)
- Clickable `SourceBadge` — when `onTap` is provided, the badge shows an `open_in_new` icon and wraps in `InkWell`. Tapping opens the external URL in the system browser (`source_badge.dart`)
- `externalUrl` parameter on `MediaDetailView` — passes URL to `SourceBadge.onTap` via `_launchExternalUrl()` using `url_launcher` (`media_detail_view.dart`)
- `externalUrl` field on `_MediaConfig` in `ItemDetailScreen` — extracted from `game.externalUrl` / `movie.externalUrl` / `tvShow.externalUrl` and forwarded to `MediaDetailView` (`item_detail_screen.dart`)
- Database migration v20 → v21 — `ALTER TABLE games/movies_cache/tv_shows_cache ADD COLUMN external_url TEXT` (`database_service.dart`)
- `url` added to IGDB `_gameFields` query — fetched for all game endpoints (`igdb_api.dart`)
- CLI scripts: `external_url` field added to `_gameToDb()`, `_movieToDb()`, `_tvShowToDb()` in `generate_demo_collections.dart` and `generate_all_snes.dart`
- Demo Collections Generator — CLI scripts (`tool/generate_demo_collections.dart`, `tool/generate_all_snes.dart`) for generating `.xcollx` demo files from IGDB/TMDB APIs, with `tool/README.md` documentation
- `DemoCollectionsScreen` — debug screen accessible from Developer Tools for generating demo collections with various platforms and media types (`demo_collections_screen.dart`)
- `IgdbApi.getTopGamesByPlatform()` — fetches top-rated games for a specific platform from IGDB (`igdb_api.dart`)
- Tests: `externalUrl` coverage in `game_test.dart`, `movie_test.dart`, `tv_show_test.dart`, `source_badge_test.dart` (onTap group), `media_detail_view_test.dart` (External URL group)
- Settings redesign — two responsive layouts: mobile (< 800px) flat iOS-style list with `SettingsGroup`/`SettingsTile` and push-navigation, desktop (≥ 800px) sidebar + content panel with instant section switching (`settings_screen.dart`)
- `SettingsGroup` widget — flat group with optional uppercase title, `surfaceLight` container, dividers between children (`settings_group.dart`)
- `SettingsTile` widget — thin settings row (~44px) with title, optional value, trailing widget, and chevron icon (`settings_tile.dart`)
- `SettingsSidebar` widget — desktop sidebar (200px) with selectable items, separator support, brand-color highlight (`settings_sidebar.dart`)
- Content widgets extracted from Screen files for reuse in both mobile push-nav and desktop inline panel: `CredentialsContent`, `CacheContent`, `DatabaseContent`, `CreditsContent`, `TraktImportContent` (`lib/features/settings/content/`)
- Localization: `settingsConnections`, `settingsApiKeys`, `settingsApiKeysValue`, `settingsData`, `settingsCacheValue` keys (EN + RU)
- Tests: `settings_group_test.dart`, `settings_tile_test.dart`, `settings_sidebar_test.dart` — widget tests for new settings components

### Changed
- `SettingsScreen` rewritten with dual-layout architecture — mobile layout uses `SettingsGroup`/`SettingsTile` instead of `SettingsSection`/`SettingsNavRow`, desktop layout uses `SettingsSidebar` + content panel (`settings_screen.dart`)
- `CredentialsScreen`, `CacheScreen`, `DatabaseScreen`, `CreditsScreen`, `TraktImportScreen` converted to thin wrappers delegating body to extracted Content widgets
- `settings_screen_test.dart` rewritten for new widget structure (SettingsGroup/SettingsTile/SettingsSidebar), mobile/desktop layout tests
- `navigation_shell_test.dart` updated — "Credentials" → "API Keys" label, `ListTile` → direct text finder for settings navigation tests
- Auto-load platforms from IGDB when searching games and opening collections — eliminates "Unknown Platform" chips without manual "Sync Platforms". `IgdbApi.fetchPlatformsByIds()` fetches only needed platforms, `GameRepository.ensurePlatformsCached()` checks DB cache first and fetches missing ones, `CollectionItemsNotifier._loadItems()` triggers lazy load on first open (`igdb_api.dart`, `game_repository.dart`, `collections_provider.dart`)
- Platforms included in full export/import (.xcollx) — `_collectMediaData()` collects platform IDs from game items and exports `Platform.toDb()` into `media['platforms']`, `_restoreEmbeddedMedia()` restores them via `Platform.fromDb()` → `upsertPlatforms()` for offline import (`export_service.dart`, `import_service.dart`)
- `DatabaseService.getPlatformsByIds()` public method — parameterized `SELECT ... WHERE id IN (?)` query, replaces inline SQL in `_loadJoinedData()` (`database_service.dart`)
- Unified media accessors on `CollectionItem` — `releaseYear`, `runtime`, `totalSeasons`, `totalEpisodes`, `genresString`, `genres`, `mediaStatus`, `formattedRating`, `dataSource`, `imageType`, `placeholderIcon` getters that resolve media-type-specific data (game/movie/tvShow/animation) through a single `_resolvedMedia` record. Eliminates switch-on-mediaType boilerplate in UI code (`collection_item.dart`)
- Unified media accessors on `CanvasItem` — `mediaTitle`, `mediaThumbnailUrl`, `mediaImageType`, `mediaCacheId`, `mediaPlaceholderIcon` getters for canvas media elements (`canvas_item.dart`)
- `DataSource` enum extracted to standalone model (`data_source.dart`), re-exported from `source_badge.dart` for backward compatibility
- Uncategorized info banner on item detail screen — informs user that Board and episode tracking require a collection, with "Add to Collection" action button (`item_detail_screen.dart`)
- Seasons/episodes summary text for uncategorized TV shows and animated series — displays "X seasons • Y ep" as a simple text row instead of the full episode tracker (`item_detail_screen.dart`)
- Localization: `uncategorizedBanner`, `uncategorizedBannerAction` keys (EN + RU)
- Tests: 10 new widget tests for uncategorized banner and seasons info (`item_detail_screen_test.dart`)

### Changed
- `CollectionScreen` grid cards now use `CollectionItem` unified accessors (`item.imageType`, `item.releaseYear`, `item.genresString`) instead of local `_imageTypeFor()`, `_yearFor()`, `_subtitleFor()` helper methods — removed ~55 lines of switch boilerplate (`collection_screen.dart`)
- `CanvasView` media card rendering now uses `CanvasItem` unified accessors instead of inline switch statements (`canvas_view.dart`)
- `ExportService` now uses `CollectionItem.dataSource` accessor instead of switch-on-mediaType (`export_service.dart`)

### Removed
- Removed SignPath code signing policy section from `README.md` (certificate info, team roles, privacy policy)
- Removed SignPath code signing policy block, CSS styles, and i18n translations (EN + RU) from landing page (`docs/index.html`)

## [0.15.0] - 2026-02-25

### Added
- Discover feed on Search screen — shown when search field is empty. Horizontal poster rows for Trending, Top Rated Movies, Popular TV Shows, Upcoming, Anime, Top Rated TV Shows. Customizable via bottom sheet (toggle sections, hide owned items). Customize button in AppBar (`discover_feed.dart`, `discover_row.dart`, `discover_customize_sheet.dart`, `discover_provider.dart`)
- Recommendations section on item detail screen — "Similar Movies" / "Similar TV Shows" from TMDB `/similar` endpoint, displayed as horizontal poster row below Activity & Progress. Tap to view details with "Add to Collection" button (`recommendations_section.dart`)
- Reviews section on item detail screen — TMDB user reviews displayed as expandable cards with author, rating, date, and content (`reviews_section.dart`, `tmdb_review.dart`)
- Show/hide recommendations toggle in Settings — `showRecommendations` boolean in SettingsState, SwitchListTile in Settings screen (`settings_provider.dart`, `settings_screen.dart`)
- `ScrollableRowWithArrows` widget — overlay left/right arrow buttons for horizontal lists on desktop (width >= 600px), with gradient backgrounds and smooth scroll animation (`scrollable_row_with_arrows.dart`)
- `HorizontalMouseScroll` widget — converts vertical mouse wheel events to horizontal scroll for horizontal lists (`horizontal_mouse_scroll.dart`)
- `TmdbReview` model — TMDB review data with author, content, rating, URL, date (`tmdb_review.dart`)
- TMDB API: `getMovieRecommendations()`, `getTvShowRecommendations()`, `getMovieReviews()`, `getTvShowReviews()`, `discoverMovies()`, `discoverTvShows()`, Discover list providers (trending, top rated, popular, upcoming, anime) (`tmdb_api.dart`, `discover_provider.dart`)
- TMDB API: lazy-cached genre map resolution — `genre_ids` (numbers) resolved to `genres` (names) across all list endpoints (search, discover, recommendations, trending, popular, multiSearch) via `_ensureMovieGenreMap()` / `_ensureTvGenreMap()` / `_resolveGenreIds()`. Cache invalidated on language change and API key clear (`tmdb_api.dart`)
- `MediaDetailsSheet`: added `genres` parameter — displays genre chips in the detail bottom sheet (`media_details_sheet.dart`)
- `MediaDetailView`: added `recommendationSections` parameter — renders recommendation/review widgets outside the ExpansionTile, always visible (`media_detail_view.dart`)
- Localization: 30+ new ARB keys for Discover, recommendations, reviews UI (EN + RU)
- Tests: `discover_provider_test.dart`, `discover_row_test.dart`, `media_details_sheet_test.dart`, `tmdb_review_test.dart`, `horizontal_mouse_scroll_test.dart`, `scrollable_row_with_arrows_test.dart`, `settings_provider_show_recommendations_test.dart`

### Changed
- Eager preload of seasons AND episodes when adding a TV show or animated series — `_preloadSeasonsAsync()` now fetches episodes for each season (cache → API → save), awaited before showing snackbar instead of fire-and-forget, guaranteeing offline access to episode tracker data (`search_screen.dart`)
- All add-to-collection methods now call `upsertMovie()` / `upsertTvShow()` before `addItem()` — ensures media model is cached in DB for offline access. Previously only `_addMovieToAnyCollection` and `_addTvShowToAnyCollection` did this; now all 8 methods (movie, TV show, animation movie, animation TV show × direct/picker) are consistent (`search_screen.dart`)
- TMDB poster URL size reduced from `w500` to `w342` in `Movie.fromJson()`, `TvShow.fromJson()`, `TvSeason.fromJson()` — ~40% smaller downloads, sufficient for all poster display sizes (100–130px logical) (`movie.dart`, `tv_show.dart`, `tv_season.dart`)
- `posterThumbUrl` getter now uses `RegExp(r'/w\d+')` instead of hardcoded `'/w500'` — works correctly with both new `w342` URLs and legacy `w500` URLs stored in database (`movie.dart`, `tv_show.dart`)
- Rewrote episode tracker auto-status logic (`_checkAutoComplete` → `_updateAutoStatus`) — now handles all transitions: notStarted ↔ inProgress ↔ completed, supports `MediaType.animation`, fetches TV details from TMDB API when cache is missing `totalEpisodes`/`totalSeasons` (`episode_tracker_provider.dart`)
- Added `clearStartedAt` / `clearCompletedAt` flags to `CollectionItem.copyWith()` — allows resetting nullable date fields to null (`collection_item.dart`)
- `DatabaseService.updateItemStatus()` now clears/sets dates based on status: `notStarted` clears both dates, `inProgress` clears `completedAt` and sets `startedAt` if missing (`database_service.dart`)
- `CollectionItemsNotifier.updateStatus()` mirrors DB date logic in local state for instant UI updates (`collections_provider.dart`)
- Owned badge (check_circle icon) now shown on Recommendations section, matching Discover feed behavior (`recommendations_section.dart`)
- Mouse drag-to-scroll enabled in horizontal rows via `ScrollConfiguration` with `PointerDeviceKind.mouse`, scrollbar hidden (`scrollable_row_with_arrows.dart`)
- Swapped navigation icons — Collections uses `shelves` icon, Wishlist uses `bookmark`/`bookmark_border` (across navigation, empty states, welcome screen, dialogs) (`navigation_shell.dart`, `home_screen.dart`, `collection_screen.dart`, `wishlist_screen.dart`, `add_wishlist_dialog.dart`, `welcome_step_how_it_works.dart`, `trakt_import_screen.dart`)
- Removed all `debugPrint` diagnostic logging from episode tracker (`episode_tracker_provider.dart`, `episode_tracker_section.dart`)

### Fixed
- Fixed `EpisodeTrackerSection` being rendered for uncategorized items (where `collectionId` is null) — episode tracking requires a real `collection_id` in the `watched_episodes` DB table, so the section is now hidden when `collectionId` is null (`item_detail_screen.dart`)
- Fixed poster image cache miss when opening detail sheet from Discover feed and Recommendations — was using `posterThumbUrl` (w154) while poster cards used `posterUrl` (w500), causing re-download. Now both use `posterUrl` for consistent caching (`discover_feed.dart`, `recommendations_section.dart`)
- Fixed genres displaying as numeric IDs (e.g., "18, 53") instead of names (e.g., "Drama, Thriller") in Discover feed and Recommendations — TMDB list endpoints return `genre_ids` which were passed as-is to `Movie.fromJson()` (`tmdb_api.dart`)
- Fixed `completedAt` date not being set when marking all episodes as watched — TMDB search/list APIs don't return `number_of_episodes`/`number_of_seasons`, so cached TvShow had null values; now `_updateAutoStatus` fetches full TV details from `/tv/{id}` endpoint on first use and caches result (`episode_tracker_provider.dart`)
- Fixed `started_at` not being set when first episode is marked as watched — auto-transition to `inProgress` now triggers `started_at` in both DB and local state (`episode_tracker_provider.dart`, `collections_provider.dart`, `database_service.dart`)
- Fixed no reverse transition when unchecking all episodes — status now resets to `notStarted` with cleared dates; unchecking from `completed` transitions back to `inProgress` (`episode_tracker_provider.dart`)
- Fixed episode tracker only searching for `MediaType.tvShow`, missing `MediaType.animation` items (`episode_tracker_provider.dart`)
- Fixed Discover and genre caches not invalidating on TMDB language change — added `ref.watch(settingsNotifierProvider.select(...tmdbLanguage))` to all Discover providers and genre providers (`discover_provider.dart`, `genre_provider.dart`)

## [0.14.0] - 2026-02-24

### Changed
- Redesigned `StatusChipRow` from Wrap of chip-buttons to "piano-style" segmented bar — full-width `Row` of `Expanded` segments, flat color fill, icon-only (no text, no borders, no rounded corners), tooltip with localized label (`status_chip_row.dart`)
- Replaced emoji status icons with Material icons across the app — `ItemStatus.icon` (emoji String) replaced by `materialIcon` (IconData): `radio_button_unchecked` (notStarted), `play_arrow_rounded` (inProgress), `check_circle` (completed), `pause_circle_filled` (dropped), `bookmark` (planned) (`item_status.dart`)
- Updated `StatusRibbon` to show Material icon instead of emoji + text — icon-only diagonal ribbon on collection cards (`status_ribbon.dart`)
- Updated `MediaPosterCard` status badge to use Material `Icon` instead of emoji `Text` (`media_poster_card.dart`)
- Swapped navigation icons — Collections uses `bookmark_border`/`bookmark`, Wishlist uses `collections_bookmark_outlined`/`collections_bookmark` (`navigation_shell.dart`, `home_screen.dart`, `collection_screen.dart`, `wishlist_screen.dart`, `add_wishlist_dialog.dart`, `welcome_step_how_it_works.dart`, `trakt_import_screen.dart`)
- Changed edit buttons in Author's Review and My Notes from `TextButton.icon` to `IconButton` — icon-only pencil, no "Edit" text (`media_detail_view.dart`)
- Moved Activity Dates from collapsed `ExpansionTile` to always-visible compact horizontal `Wrap` under My Rating — editable Started/Completed with `DatePicker`, readonly Added/Last Activity (`media_detail_view.dart`, `item_detail_screen.dart`)
- Removed `ItemStatus.onHold` status — simplified from 6 to 5 statuses (notStarted, inProgress, completed, dropped, planned). DB migration v20 converts existing `on_hold` items to `not_started`. Removed `onHold` from `CollectionStats`, `StatusChipRow` filtering, `AppColors.statusOnHold`, Trakt import priority mapping, and `statusOnHold` ARB keys (`item_status.dart`, `database_service.dart`, `collection_repository.dart`, `status_chip_row.dart`, `app_colors.dart`, `trakt_zip_import_service.dart`)
- Unified 4 detail screens (`GameDetailScreen`, `MovieDetailScreen`, `TvShowDetailScreen`, `AnimeDetailScreen`) into single `ItemDetailScreen` — media type determined from `CollectionItem.mediaType`, UI configured via `_MediaConfig` class (`item_detail_screen.dart`)
- Replaced TabBar (Details/Board tabs) with Board toggle IconButton in AppBar — `Icons.dashboard` (active) / `Icons.dashboard_outlined` (inactive), no more `SingleTickerProviderStateMixin` or `TabController`
- Extracted episode tracker into shared `EpisodeTrackerSection` widget with `accentColor` parameter — reused for TV Show and Animation (tvShow source) (`episode_tracker_section.dart`)
- Simplified navigation in `collection_screen.dart` and `all_items_screen.dart` — replaced 4-case media type switch with single `ItemDetailScreen` call
- Unified 4 detail screen test files into single `item_detail_screen_test.dart`
- Replaced hardcoded `'Season N'` fallback with localized `seasonName` ARB key, replaced `'min'` with `runtimeMinutes` in episode tracker (`episode_tracker_section.dart`)

### Fixed
- Fixed RenderFlex overflow in Author's Review and My Notes section headers on narrow screens — wrapped inner `Row` with `Expanded` + `Flexible` + `TextOverflow.ellipsis` (`media_detail_view.dart`)

### Removed
- `GameDetailScreen` (`game_detail_screen.dart`, 601 lines), `MovieDetailScreen` (`movie_detail_screen.dart`, 638 lines), `TvShowDetailScreen` (`tv_show_detail_screen.dart`, 1082 lines), `AnimeDetailScreen` (`anime_detail_screen.dart`, 1185 lines) — replaced by unified `ItemDetailScreen`
- `detailsTab` ARB key — no longer needed after TabBar removal
- 4 old detail screen test files (`game_detail_screen_test.dart`, `movie_detail_screen_test.dart`, `tv_show_detail_screen_test.dart`, `anime_detail_screen_test.dart`)
- `ItemStatus.icon` emoji getter, `displayText()` and `localizedText()` methods — replaced by `materialIcon` getter (`item_status.dart`)
- Private `_statusIcon()` function from `status_chip_row.dart` — icon mapping moved to `ItemStatus.materialIcon`

### Added
- Full i18n localization (English / Russian) — Flutter `gen_l10n` infrastructure with 521 ARB keys, ICU MessageFormat plurals for Russian (`=0`, `=1`, `few`, `other`), output class `S` with `nullable-getter: false` (`l10n.yaml`, `lib/l10n/app_en.arb`, `lib/l10n/app_ru.arb`)
- App Language setting — `SettingsNotifier.setAppLanguage()` with `SegmentedButton` (English / Русский) in Settings, persisted via SharedPreferences, applied to `MaterialApp.locale` in `app.dart` (`settings_provider.dart`, `settings_screen.dart`, `app.dart`)
- Localized extension methods on enums — `ItemStatus.localizedLabel(S, MediaType)`, `MediaType.localizedLabel(S)`, `CollectionSortMode.localizedDisplayLabel(S)` / `localizedShortLabel(S)` / `localizedDescription(S)`, `SearchSortField.localizedShortLabel(S)` / `localizedDisplayLabel(S)` (`item_status.dart`, `media_type.dart`, `collection_sort_mode.dart`, `search_sort.dart`)
- `flutter_localizations` and `intl` dependencies (`pubspec.yaml`)
- Localization delegates added to all ~64 test files for `MaterialApp` compatibility

### Changed
- Replaced all hardcoded English UI strings (~50 files) with `S.of(context).key` calls — navigation labels, screen titles, buttons, dialogs, tooltips, error messages, empty states, form hints
- `StatusChipRow` and `StatusRibbon` now use `localizedLabel(S.of(context), mediaType)` instead of `displayLabel(mediaType)` (`status_chip_row.dart`, `status_ribbon.dart`)
- Cached Navigator widget instances in `NavigationShell._navigatorWidgets` to prevent route history loss during locale-triggered rebuilds (`navigation_shell.dart`)

### Removed
- `AppStrings` constants class — all values inlined or replaced by l10n keys (`app_strings.dart`, `app_strings_test.dart`)

### Added
- Credits screen with API provider attribution — TMDB (mandatory), IGDB, SteamGridDB logos + disclaimer text + external links, Open Source section with MIT license info and `showLicensePage()` button (`credits_screen.dart`)
- "About" section in Settings — app version from `PackageInfo` and "Credits & Licenses" navigation row (`settings_screen.dart`)
- `flutter_svg` dependency for rendering SVG logos in Credits screen (`pubspec.yaml`)
- SVG logos for TMDB, IGDB, SteamGridDB in `assets/credits/` (app) and `docs/assets/` (landing page)

- 7 new tests for `SettingsScreen` About section: section visibility, Version/Credits nav rows, icons, tappability, version placeholder (`settings_screen_test.dart`)
- Trakt.tv ZIP import — offline import from Trakt data export: watched movies/shows → collection items, ratings → userRating, watchlist → planned/wishlist, watched episodes → episode tracker. Animation detection via TMDB genres. Conflict resolution (status hierarchy, ratings only if null, episodes merge). `TraktZipImportService` with `validateZip()` and `importFromZip()` methods, progress reporting via `ImportProgress` (`trakt_zip_import_service.dart`)
- Trakt Import screen — file picker, ZIP validation preview (username, counts), import options (watched/ratings/watchlist checkboxes), target collection selector (new or existing), progress dialog with `ValueNotifier` + `LinearProgressIndicator` (`trakt_import_screen.dart`)
- "Trakt Import" navigation row in Settings screen (`settings_screen.dart`)
- `archive` dependency (^4.0.2) for cross-platform ZIP extraction (`pubspec.yaml`)
- `DatabaseService.findCollectionItem()` — lookup by (collectionId, mediaType, externalId) for import conflict resolution (`database_service.dart`)

- `--dart-define=TMDB_API_KEY` and `--dart-define=STEAMGRIDDB_API_KEY` in CI release workflow for Linux build (`release.yml`)
- Platform safety guards for VgMapsPanel — `Platform.isWindows` check in `initState()` and `build()` prevents WebView initialization on non-Windows platforms (`vgmaps_panel.dart`)
- `kVgMapsEnabled` gate around VgMapsPanel Consumer in all 5 detail screens — prevents unnecessary provider watching on non-Windows platforms (`game_detail_screen.dart`, `movie_detail_screen.dart`, `tv_show_detail_screen.dart`, `anime_detail_screen.dart`, `collection_screen.dart`)
- 8 new tests for `platform_features.dart`: `kCanvasEnabled`, `kVgMapsEnabled`, `kScreenshotEnabled`, `kIsMobile`, `isLandscapeMobile` (`platform_features_test.dart`)
- Built-in API tokens for TMDB and SteamGridDB via `--dart-define` — `ApiDefaults` class with `String.fromEnvironment` for compile-time key injection (`api_defaults.dart`)
- Three-tier API key fallback in `SettingsNotifier._loadFromPrefs()` — user key (SharedPreferences) → built-in key (dart-define) → null (`settings_provider.dart`)
- `isTmdbKeyBuiltIn` / `isSteamGridDbKeyBuiltIn` getters on `SettingsState` for detecting active built-in keys
- `resetTmdbApiKeyToDefault()` / `resetSteamGridDbApiKeyToDefault()` methods on `SettingsNotifier` to revert to built-in keys

- Hint recommending own API keys for better rate limits, shown when built-in key is active
- `--dart-define=TMDB_API_KEY` and `--dart-define=STEAMGRIDDB_API_KEY` in CI release workflow for Windows and Android builds (`release.yml`)
- `.env` / `.env.local` added to `.gitignore` for local development keys
- 13 new tests: `ApiDefaults` constants, built-in key fallback logic, `isTmdbKeyBuiltIn`/`isSteamGridDbKeyBuiltIn`, `resetTmdbApiKeyToDefault`/`resetSteamGridDbApiKeyToDefault`

### Changed

- Added 17 new tests for `SnackBarExtension`: all 3 types with icons/colors/borders, loading mode, auto-hide, action, duration, text style, SnackBar properties, `hideSnack()` (`snackbar_extension_test.dart`)
- Auto-sync platforms on IGDB verify — `_verifyConnection()` now automatically calls `syncPlatforms()` and `_downloadLogosIfEnabled()` after successful connection (`credentials_screen.dart`)
- API key validation — `SteamGridDbApi.validateApiKey()` method for testing SteamGridDB API keys; `SettingsNotifier.validateTmdbKey()` and `validateSteamGridDbKey()` methods (`steamgriddb_api.dart`, `settings_provider.dart`)
- "Test" button in credentials screen — `_buildSaveRow()` now accepts optional `onValidate` callback; Test buttons shown for SteamGridDB and TMDB when API key is saved (`credentials_screen.dart`)
- Per-tab API key checks in search — Games tab checks IGDB credentials, Movies/TV/Animation tabs check TMDB key; missing key shows `_buildMissingApiKeyState()` with "Go to Settings" button (`search_screen.dart`)
- Smart error handling in search — `_isNetworkError()` detects connection/timeout/socket errors and shows "No internet connection" with `wifi_off` icon; API errors show error text with Retry button (`search_screen.dart`)
- Added 16 new tests: `validateApiKey` (5), `validateTmdbKey`/`validateSteamGridDbKey` (7), Test button visibility (4)
- Auto-delete empty collection prompt — after moving the last item out, a dialog asks whether to delete the now-empty collection (`game_detail_screen.dart`, `movie_detail_screen.dart`, `tv_show_detail_screen.dart`, `anime_detail_screen.dart`, `collection_screen.dart`)
- Board connection edge anchoring — connections now attach to the nearest edge center (top/bottom/left/right) instead of the item center (`CanvasConnectionPainter._getEdgePoint()`)
- Multi-page TMDB search — initial search loads 3 pages in parallel (~60 results) for movies and TV shows (`MediaSearchNotifier._fetchMoviePages()`, `_fetchTvShowPages()`)
- Added 6 new tests: canvas sync by (type, refId), orphan deletion without collectionItemId, non-media item preservation, edge point directions, drag offset edge points, diagonal edge selection

### Changed
- Migrated all 85 SnackBar calls across 13 files to unified `context.showSnack()` extension — removed all direct `ScaffoldMessenger.of(context).showSnackBar()` calls, `messenger` variables, and `_showSnackBar()` helpers (`home_screen.dart`, `collection_screen.dart`, `search_screen.dart`, `credentials_screen.dart`, `database_screen.dart`, `cache_screen.dart`, `welcome_step_api_keys.dart`, 4 detail screens, 2 debug screens)
- Simplified `snackBarTheme` in `AppTheme` — removed redundant backgroundColor, contentTextStyle, shape (now controlled by extension)
- Search screen no longer blocks all tabs when IGDB keys are missing — each tab independently checks its required API key (`search_screen.dart`)
- Simplified import — imported collections are now created as `CollectionType.own` (fully editable) instead of `CollectionType.imported` (`import_service.dart`)
- Removed fork system — deleted `fork()`, `revertToOriginal()` from `CollectionRepository` and `CollectionsNotifier`; removed "Create Copy" and "Revert to Original" UI actions; all collections now use unified folder icon and gameAccent color
- Home screen shows a flat list of all collections instead of grouping by type (own/forked/imported)
- `Collection.isEditable` now always returns `true`; removed `isFork` and `isImported` getters
- `moveItem()` returns `({bool success, bool sourceEmpty})` record type instead of `bool`
- Board connections rendered on top of items with `IgnorePointer` (previously rendered underneath)
- Increased max board element size from 2000 to 5000 (`_DraggableCanvasItemState._maxItemSize`)
- Increased IGDB search page size from 20 to 50 (`GameSearchNotifier._gamePageSize`, `GameRepository` default limit)
- Canvas sync now matches items by `(itemType, itemRefId)` pair instead of `collectionItemId`, fixing a bug where newly synced items were invisible due to `getCanvasItems` filtering by `collection_item_id IS NULL`

### Fixed
- Fixed canvas not displaying items added to collection — `_syncCanvasWithItems()` was setting `collectionItemId` on created items, but `getCanvasItems()` SQL query filters by `collection_item_id IS NULL`, making them invisible. Items are now created without `collectionItemId`, consistent with `initializeCanvas()`

### Removed
- Removed `_showSnackBar()` private helper method from `SteamGridDbDebugScreen`
- Removed all direct `ScaffoldMessenger` usage from feature screens (13 files) — replaced by `snackbar_extension.dart`
- Removed `CollectionRepository.fork()` and `revertToOriginal()` methods
- Removed `CollectionsNotifier.fork()` and `revertToOriginal()` methods
- Removed `importedCollectionsProvider` and `forkedCollectionsProvider`
- Removed "Revert to Original" menu option from `CollectionScreen`
- Removed "Create Copy" option from `HomeScreen` collection context menu
- Removed Imported/Forked section headers from `HomeScreen`

## [0.11.0] - 2026-02-21

  - `UpdateService` with semver comparison, 24-hour throttle via SharedPreferences, and silent error handling
  - `UpdateBanner` widget embedded in `NavigationShell` (both desktop and mobile layouts)
  - "Update" button opens the release page via `url_launcher`; dismiss button hides the banner until next launch
- Added `package_info_plus` dependency for reading current app version
- Added 27 tests: `update_service_test.dart` (19 tests — semver, throttle, cache, errors), `update_banner_test.dart` (8 tests — show/hide/dismiss/loading/error states)

### Changed
- Replaced debug signing with release keystore for Android APK (`android/app/build.gradle.kts`)
  - Signing config reads from environment variables (CI) with fallback to `key.properties` (local)
  - All future APK updates install over previous versions without uninstalling
- Changed `applicationId` and `namespace` from `com.example.xerabora` to `com.hacan359.tonkatsubox`
- Moved `MainActivity.kt` to `com.hacan359.tonkatsubox` package
- Updated `release.yml` CI workflow to decode keystore from GitHub Secrets and pass signing env variables

## [0.10.0] - 2026-02-20

### Added

  - Step 1 «Welcome»: app capabilities, media types, works-without-keys section
  - Step 2 «API Keys»: IGDB (required), TMDB (recommended), SteamGridDB (optional) instructions with external links
  - Step 3 «How it works»: app structure (5 tabs), Quick Start (5 steps), sharing formats (.xcoll/.xcollx)
  - Step 4 «Ready!»: CTA buttons — «Go to Settings» (→ NavigationShell with Settings tab) or «Skip» (→ Home)
  - PageView with swipe, step indicators, progress bar, Skip link, Back/Next navigation, dot indicators
  - `kWelcomeCompletedKey` flag saved in SharedPreferences
  - Re-openable from Settings → Help → «Welcome Guide» (with `fromSettings: true` → pop on finish)
- Added `initialTab` parameter to `NavigationShell` — allows opening app on a specific tab (used by Welcome Wizard → Settings)
- Added «Help» section in `SettingsScreen` with «Welcome Guide» navigation row (icon: `Icons.school`)
- Added `docs/guides/` — source-of-truth markdown for wizard content: `WELCOME.md`, `API_KEYS.md`, `HOW_IT_WORKS.md`
- Added 173 tests for Welcome Wizard: `welcome_screen_test.dart` (32 tests), `step_indicator_test.dart` (16 tests), `welcome_step_intro_test.dart` (14 tests), `welcome_step_api_keys_test.dart` (20 tests), `welcome_step_how_it_works_test.dart` (16 tests), `welcome_step_ready_test.dart` (13 tests), plus updates to `settings_screen_test.dart`, `navigation_shell_test.dart`, `app_test.dart`

### Changed
- Modified `SplashScreen._tryNavigate()` to check `welcome_completed` flag — routes to `WelcomeScreen` on first launch, `NavigationShell` on subsequent launches
- Replaced `AddWishlistSheet` (bottom sheet) with `AddWishlistForm` — full-page form screen with `AutoBreadcrumbAppBar`, breadcrumb navigation ("Add" / "Edit"), and TextButton action in AppBar
- Added title validation (minimum 2 characters) with inline `errorText` that clears on input in `AddWishlistForm`
- Added `showCheckmark: false` to media type `ChoiceChip`s — fixes checkmark overlapping the avatar icon
- Added `runSpacing` to media type chips `Wrap` for better multi-line layout

### Added
- Added 5 reusable settings widgets (`lib/features/settings/widgets/`): `SettingsSection` (Card with header, icon, trailing), `SettingsRow` (ListTile wrapper), `SettingsNavRow` (navigation row with chevron), `StatusDot` (icon + label indicator), `InlineTextField` (tap-to-edit with blur/Enter commit, visibility toggle, gamepad D-pad support)
- Added compact mode (width < 600) across all 5 settings screens — responsive padding, icon sizes, gap spacing
- Added `AppColors.brand` (#EF7B44), `brandLight`, `brandPale` as the dedicated app accent palette, separate from media-type accents
- Added `theme-color` meta tag (#EF7B44) to landing page (`docs/index.html`)
- Added TMDB content language setting (Russian / English) in Settings via SegmentedButton
- Added `BreadcrumbScope` InheritedWidget (`lib/shared/widgets/breadcrumb_scope.dart`) — accumulates breadcrumb labels up the widget tree via `visitAncestorElements`
- Added `AutoBreadcrumbAppBar` (`lib/shared/widgets/auto_breadcrumb_app_bar.dart`) — reads `BreadcrumbScope` chain and generates clickable breadcrumb navigation automatically
- Added tab root `BreadcrumbScope` in `NavigationShell._buildTabNavigator()` — provides root label ('Main', 'Collections', 'Wishlist', 'Search', 'Settings') to all routes
- Added tests for `BreadcrumbScope` (6 tests) and `AutoBreadcrumbAppBar` (8 tests)

### Fixed
- Fixed missing `mounted` check after async operations in `CacheScreen` (3 `setState` calls after `await`)
- Fixed SnackBar leak in `CredentialsScreen._downloadLogosIfEnabled()` — added try/catch around download to properly hide progress SnackBar on exception
- Fixed route transition overlap: transparent Scaffold backgrounds caused content of both pages to show through each other during navigation. Added `_OpaquePageTransitionsBuilder` in `PageTransitionsTheme` — each route now gets its own opaque `DecoratedBox` with tiled background, preventing bleed-through
- Added `cacheWidth`/`cacheHeight` to `Image.file()` in `CachedImage` and `memCacheWidth: 300` to `MediaPosterCard` — reduces decoded image memory for poster cards

### Changed
- Refactored 5 settings screens (`settings_screen`, `credentials_screen`, `cache_screen`, `database_screen`, `debug_hub_screen`) to use shared `SettingsSection`, `SettingsNavRow`, `SettingsRow`, `StatusDot`, `InlineTextField` widgets — net reduction ~200 lines, eliminated manual `Card > Padding > Column > Row` patterns
- Replaced AlertDialog for author name editing with inline `InlineTextField` on `SettingsScreen`
- Replaced 4 `TextEditingController` + 2 `FocusNode` + 3 obscure booleans in `CredentialsScreen` with 4 local String variables — `InlineTextField` manages its own state
- Recolored app palette: introduced `AppColors.brand` (#EF7B44) as the primary UI accent, replacing `gameAccent` in 15 screens/widgets (theme, navigation, snackbar, focus indicator, chips, progress bars, settings headers)
- Updated media accent colors: games #707DD2 (indigo), movies #EF7B44 (orange), TV shows #B1E140 (lime), animation #A86ED4 (purple)
- Unified `MediaTypeTheme` to delegate to `AppColors` constants — was hardcoded Material colors (#2196F3, #F44336, #4CAF50, #9C27B0)
- Recolored landing page (`docs/index.html`): new CSS variables (`--brand`, `--brand-light`, `--brand-pale`), updated media accent colors, CTA buttons, glow effects, showcase shadows, media-tag borders, section labels
- Updated Wishlist appbar icon colors to `AppColors.textSecondary` (was default white)
- Refactored `CollectionItem` media resolution: replaced 5 identical `switch(mediaType)` blocks with a single `_resolvedMedia` getter using Dart records
- Redesigned `BreadcrumbAppBar` visual style: height 40→44px, font 12→13px, `›` separator → `Icons.chevron_right` (14px, 50% opacity), last crumb w600/textPrimary, hover pill effect (surfaceLight background, borderRadius 6), mobile collapse (>2 crumbs → first…last), mobile back button (← instead of logo), text overflow ellipsis (maxWidth 300 current / 180 intermediate), `accentColor` parameter for accent border-bottom, gamepad support (`Actions > Focus` with `FocusNode` dispose)
- Migrated all 20 screens from manual breadcrumb assembly to `BreadcrumbScope` + `AutoBreadcrumbAppBar`: Settings (8 screens), Collections (6 screens), Home, Search, Wishlist tabs
- Removed `collectionName` parameter from detail screens (`GameDetailScreen`, `MovieDetailScreen`, `TvShowDetailScreen`, `AnimeDetailScreen`) — breadcrumb labels now come from scope chain
- Updated 12 test files to wrap screens in `BreadcrumbScope` and adapt to new separator icon

### Removed
- Removed decorative logo watermark from Collections screen (`home_screen.dart`) — Stack with 300×300 logo at 4% opacity
- Removed `BreadcrumbAppBar.collectionFallback()` factory constructor — replaced by `AutoBreadcrumbAppBar` with `BreadcrumbScope`
- Removed `_buildFallbackAppBar()` methods from all 4 detail screens
- Removed `DecoratedBox` from `MaterialApp.builder` in `app.dart` — tiled background now applied per-route via `PageTransitionsTheme`

- Добавлены тесты: `database_service_test.dart` (+11 тестов: multi-platform UNIQUE index, getUniquePlatformIds), `all_items_provider_test.dart` (+5 тестов: allItemsPlatformsProvider), `all_items_screen_test.dart` (+4 теста: платформенный фильтр), `canvas_repository_test.dart` (+2 теста: deleteByCollectionItemId)

### Changed
- Рефакторинг синхронизации канваса (`canvas_provider.dart`) — ключи элементов изменены с `"mediaType:externalId"` на `collectionItemId` (уникальный PK), что позволяет корректно различать одну игру на разных платформах
- Обновлена `_syncCanvasWithItems()` и `removeByCollectionItemId()` в `CanvasNotifier` для работы с `collectionItemId`

  - `PopupMenuButton` на экранах деталей (Game, Movie, TV Show, Anime) — пункты «Move to Collection» и «Remove» (заменяет одиночную кнопку Remove)
  - `PopupMenuButton` на тайлах `_CollectionItemTile` в `CollectionScreen` — «Move» и «Remove» (заменяет одиночный `IconButton` Remove)
- Добавлены тесты: `anime_detail_screen_test.dart` (31 тест), `collection_picker_dialog_test.dart` (12 тестов), `database_service_test.dart` (тесты updateItemCollectionId), дополнены `collection_repository_test.dart` (moveItemToCollection: success, duplicate, not found)

### Changed

- Обновлены провайдеры канваса, SteamGridDB панели, VGMaps панели и трекера эпизодов для поддержки nullable `collectionId`

### Fixed

- Исправлена валидация кэша: `ImageCacheService.isImageCached()` теперь проверяет целостность файла через magic bytes (`_isValidImageFile`), а не только существование
- Исправлено сохранение пустых файлов в кэш: `ImageCacheService.saveImageBytes()` отклоняет пустые данные (`bytes.isEmpty`)
- Исправлен сброс БД не обновляющий UI — элементы оставались на экранах до перезапуска приложения

### Added
- Добавлен виджет `BreadcrumbAppBar` (`lib/shared/widgets/breadcrumb_app_bar.dart`) — навигационные хлебные крошки: логотип 20x20 + разделители `›` + кликабельные крошки. Поддержка `bottom` (TabBar), `actions`, горизонтальный скролл. Последняя крошка — жирная (w600), остальные кликабельные (w400)
- Добавлен экран-хаб `SettingsScreen` — 4 карточки навигации: Credentials, Cache, Database, Debug (только kDebugMode). Заменяет монолитный экран настроек (~1118 строк)
- Добавлены подэкраны настроек: `CredentialsScreen` (IGDB/SteamGridDB/TMDB API ключи), `CacheScreen` (кэш изображений), `DatabaseScreen` (export/import/reset), `DebugHubScreen` (3 debug-инструмента)
- Добавлен параметр `collectionName` в экраны деталей (`GameDetailScreen`, `MovieDetailScreen`, `TvShowDetailScreen`, `AnimeDetailScreen`) для отображения в хлебных крошках

### Changed
- Все экраны переведены на `BreadcrumbAppBar` вместо стандартного AppBar: AllItemsScreen, HomeScreen, CollectionScreen, SearchScreen, все detail screens, все debug screens
- Логотип вынесен выше NavigationRail в `NavigationShell` (desktop) — `Column(logo, Expanded(Rail))` вместо `Rail.leading`
- Реструктуризация Settings: монолитный экран (~1118 строк) разбит на хаб + 4 подэкрана с навигацией через `Navigator.push`
- Debug screens (IGDB Media, SteamGridDB, Gamepad) используют `BreadcrumbAppBar` с крошками Settings › Debug › {name}

### Removed
- Удалён монолитный код SettingsScreen (секции credentials, cache, database, danger zone — перенесены в отдельные экраны)
- Удалён `settings_screen_config_test.dart` — покрытие перенесено в `database_screen_test.dart`

### Added
- Добавлен экран All Items (Home tab) — отображает все элементы из всех коллекций в grid-виде с PosterCard, именем коллекции как subtitle. Чипсы фильтрации по типу медиа (All/Games/Movies/TV Shows/Animation) и ActionChip сортировки по рейтингу (toggle asc/desc). Loading, empty, error states. RefreshIndicator
- Добавлена 4-табная навигация: Home (все элементы), Collections, Search, Settings. Ранее было 3 таба: Home (коллекции), Search, Settings
- Добавлены провайдеры `allItemsSortProvider`, `allItemsSortDescProvider`, `allItemsNotifierProvider`, `collectionNamesProvider` (`lib/features/home/providers/all_items_provider.dart`)
- Добавлены методы `DatabaseService.getAllCollectionItems()` и `getAllCollectionItemsWithData()` — загрузка элементов из всех коллекций (с опциональной фильтрацией по типу медиа)
- Добавлен метод `CollectionRepository.getAllItemsWithData()`
- Добавлена утилита `applySortMode()` (`lib/features/collections/providers/sort_utils.dart`) — вынесена общая логика сортировки из `CollectionItemsNotifier`

### Changed
- Изменена навигация `NavigationShell`: `NavTab` enum расширен до 4 значений (home, collections, search, settings), `_tabCount = 4`, `AllItemsScreen` загружается eager, остальные tabs lazy
- Рефакторинг `CollectionItemsNotifier._applySortMode()` → вызывает shared `applySortMode()` из `sort_utils.dart`
- Добавлена инвалидация `allItemsNotifierProvider` при добавлении/удалении элементов в `CollectionItemsNotifier`
- Исправлен баг `_loadFromPrefs()` в sort-нотифайерах: добавлен `await Future<void>.value()` чтобы state не перезаписывался return в build()

### Changed
- Оптимизирован запуск на Android — ленивая инициализация табов в `NavigationShell`: SearchScreen и SettingsScreen строятся только при первом переключении на таб (убирает 4 тяжёлых DB-запроса и загрузку платформ при старте)
- Добавлена платформенная проверка в `GamepadService` — на мобильных (Android/iOS) сервис не запускается и не подписывается на `Gamepads.events`, что снижает нагрузку при старте
- Оптимизирован `SplashScreen` — pre-warming базы данных выполняется параллельно с 2-секундной анимацией логотипа. Навигация происходит только когда И анимация завершена, И DB открыта — это разводит DB-инициализацию и route transition по времени, предотвращая ANR на слабых устройствах
- Уменьшена длительность FadeTransition при переходе с splash на главный экран на мобильных: 200ms вместо 500ms

### Added
- Добавлен виджет `DualRatingBadge` (`lib/shared/widgets/dual_rating_badge.dart`) — двойной рейтинг `★ 8 / 7.5` (пользовательский + API). Режимы: badge (затемнённый фон на постере), compact (уменьшенный), inline (без фона, для list-карточек). Геттеры `hasRating`, `formattedRating`
- Добавлен виджет `MediaPosterCard` (`lib/shared/widgets/media_poster_card.dart`) — единая вертикальная постерная карточка с enum `CardVariant` (grid/compact/canvas). Grid/compact: hover-анимация, DualRatingBadge, отметка коллекции, статус-бейдж, title+subtitle. Canvas: Card с цветной рамкой по типу медиа, без hover/рейтинга
- Добавлены геттеры `CollectionItem.apiRating` (нормализованный 0–10: IGDB/10, TMDB as-is) и `CollectionItem.itemDescription` (game.summary / movie.overview / tvShow.overview) в `lib/shared/models/collection_item.dart`
- Добавлены тесты: `dual_rating_badge_test.dart` (25 тестов), `media_poster_card_test.dart` (46 тестов), дополнены `collection_item_test.dart` (+20 тестов apiRating/itemDescription)

### Changed
- Изменён `collection_screen.dart` — `PosterCard` заменён на `MediaPosterCard(variant: grid/compact)` с двойным рейтингом. `_CollectionItemTile` обогащён: DualRatingBadge inline, описание (1 строка), заметки пользователя (иконка `note_outlined`). Удалён метод `_normalizedRating()`
- Изменён `search_screen.dart` — `PosterCard` заменён на `MediaPosterCard(variant: grid/compact)` с API рейтингом
- Изменён `canvas_view.dart` — `CanvasGameCard`/`CanvasMediaCard` заменены на `MediaPosterCard(variant: canvas)` через единый helper `_buildMediaCard(CanvasItem)`

### Removed
- Удалён `PosterCard` (`lib/shared/widgets/poster_card.dart`) — заменён на `MediaPosterCard(variant: grid/compact)` (~340 строк)
- Удалён `MediaCard` (`lib/shared/widgets/media_card.dart`) — мёртвый код после редизайна SearchScreen (~323 строки)
- Удалены `GameCard`, `MovieCard`, `TvShowCard` (`lib/features/search/widgets/`) — мёртвый код (~361 строка)
- Удалены `CanvasGameCard`, `CanvasMediaCard` (`lib/features/collections/widgets/`) — заменены на `MediaPosterCard(variant: canvas)` (~282 строки)
- Удалены тесты удалённых виджетов: 7 файлов (~2792 строки). Итого: -3604 строки кода

### Added
- Добавлен пользовательский рейтинг (1-10) — новое поле `userRating` в `CollectionItem`, миграция БД v14→v15 (`ALTER TABLE collection_items ADD COLUMN user_rating INTEGER`), метод `DatabaseService.updateItemUserRating()`
- Добавлен виджет `StarRatingBar` (`lib/shared/widgets/star_rating_bar.dart`) — 10 кликабельных звёзд с InkWell (focusable для геймпада), повторный клик на текущий рейтинг сбрасывает оценку
- Добавлена секция "My Rating" на экранах деталей (Game, Movie, TV Show, Anime) — между Status и My Notes, отображает `StarRatingBar` с текущим значением и label "X/10"
- Добавлен режим сортировки `CollectionSortMode.rating` — сортировка по пользовательскому рейтингу (высшие первыми, без оценки — в конце)

### Changed
- Переименована секция "Author's Comment" → "Author's Review" на экранах деталей — добавлена подпись "Visible to others when shared. Your review of this title." для пояснения назначения
- Изменён порядок секций на экранах деталей: Header → Status → My Rating → **My Notes** → **Author's Review** → Activity & Progress (ранее Author's Comment шёл перед My Notes)
- Изменён `CollectionItem.copyWith()` — добавлены sentinel-флаги `clearAuthorComment` и `clearUserComment` для возможности очистки комментариев (установки в `null`)
- Изменён `CollectionItemsNotifier` — методы `updateAuthorComment` и `updateUserComment` используют sentinel-флаги при передаче `null`, добавлен метод `updateUserRating` с валидацией диапазона 1-10
- Дополнительные секции (Activity Dates, Episode Progress) обёрнуты в `ExpansionTile` "Activity & Progress" (свёрнуто по умолчанию)

### Fixed
- Исправлена невозможность очистить комментарий автора и личные заметки — `copyWith` использовал `??` для nullable String-полей, что не позволяло установить `null`

### Added
- Добавлена визуальная доска (Board) на Android — `kCanvasEnabled` теперь возвращает `true` на всех платформах, Board доступен в коллекциях и на экранах деталей (игры, фильмы, сериалы, анимация)
- Добавлено контекстное меню по long press на мобильных устройствах — long press на пустом месте доски открывает меню добавления элементов (текст/изображение/ссылка), long press на элементе — меню редактирования (Edit/Delete/Connect и т.д.)
- Увеличен размер resize handle на мобильных устройствах (24px вместо 14px) для удобства тач-ввода
- Добавлен zoom-to-fit при открытии Board — на мобильных контент автоматически масштабируется, чтобы все элементы помещались в viewport с отступами

### Changed
- Переименован «Canvas» → «Board» во всех пользовательских текстах (28 вхождений): вкладка «Board» в коллекции и на экранах деталей, tooltip замка «Lock/Unlock board», SnackBar «Image/Map added to board», кнопка «Add to Board» в VGMaps, описание формата экспорта, сообщения импорта, описание сброса БД в настройках, пустые состояния доски
- Скрыта кнопка VGMaps Browser и пункт меню «Browse maps...» на не-Windows платформах — VGMaps требует `webview_windows`, доступен только на Windows через `kVgMapsEnabled`
- Упрощена подсказка режима создания связей: «Tap an element to create a connection.» вместо «Click on an element to create a connection. Press Escape to cancel.»

### Added
- Добавлен экспорт canvas-изображений в полный экспорт `.xcollx` — изображения с канваса (`CanvasItemType.image`) теперь включаются в секцию `images` с ключом `canvas_images/{hash}`
- Добавлен полный офлайн-экспорт: секция `media` в `.xcollx` содержит данные Game/Movie/TvShow (через `toDb()` без `cached_at`). При импорте данные восстанавливаются из файла через `fromDb()` — API-вызовы не требуются
- Добавлен этап `ImportStage.restoringMedia` для отслеживания прогресса восстановления медиа-данных
- Добавлено поле `media` в `XcollFile` с поддержкой сериализации/десериализации
- Добавлен метод `ExportService._collectMediaData()` — сбор Game/Movie/TvShow из joined полей элементов с дедупликацией по ID
- Добавлены методы `ImportService._restoreEmbeddedMedia()` и `_fetchMediaFromApi()` — условный импорт: офлайн из файла или онлайн из API
- Добавлена предзагрузка сезонов сериалов при добавлении tvShow/animation-сериала в коллекцию — `_preloadSeasons()` в `SearchScreen` (fire-and-forget, не блокирует UI). Сезоны кэшируются в `tv_seasons_cache` для офлайн-доступа
- Добавлены `tv_seasons` в полный экспорт `.xcollx` — сезоны сериалов собираются из кэша БД и включаются в секцию `media.tv_seasons`. `ExportService._collectMediaData()` стал async, принимает `DatabaseService`
- Добавлено восстановление `tv_seasons` при импорте `.xcollx` — `ImportService._restoreEmbeddedMedia()` парсит `media.tv_seasons` и восстанавливает через `TvSeason.fromDb()` с отслеживанием прогресса
- Добавлены счётчики элементов на filter chips коллекции — каждый чип показывает количество: All (N), Games (N), Movies (N), TV Shows (N), Animation (N)
- Добавлены `tv_episodes` в полный экспорт `.xcollx` — эпизоды всех сезонов сериалов собираются из кэша БД и включаются в секцию `media.tv_episodes`. Метод `DatabaseService.getEpisodesByShowId()` возвращает все эпизоды сериала. Запросы сезонов и эпизодов выполняются параллельно через `Future.wait`
- Добавлено восстановление `tv_episodes` при импорте `.xcollx` — `ImportService._restoreEmbeddedMedia()` парсит `media.tv_episodes` и восстанавливает через `TvEpisode.fromDb()` / `upsertEpisodes()` с отслеживанием прогресса

### Fixed
- Исправлен маппинг `ImageType` для анимации: `_imageTypeFor()` в `CollectionScreen`, `HeroCollectionCard` и `CanvasMediaCard` теперь учитывает `platformId` — анимационные сериалы (`AnimationSource.tvShow`) отображают обложки из `tv_show_posters` вместо `movie_posters`
- Исправлена обработка повреждённых кэшированных изображений: `CachedImage` теперь при ошибке декодирования (`Codec failed to produce an image`) удаляет битый файл из кэша, показывает изображение из сети (fallback) и перекачивает файл в фоне. Добавлен метод `ImageCacheService.deleteImage()`. Флаг `_corruptHandled` предотвращает повторные вызовы при rebuild
- Исправлен диалог экспорта: выбор формата (Light/Full) теперь показывается всегда, а не только при наличии canvas данных

### Changed
- Изменён `_AppRouter` — приложение больше не блокируется без API ключей, только поиск недоступен
- Изменён `SearchScreen` — при отсутствии API ключей показывает заглушку вместо интерфейса поиска
- Увеличена ширина кнопок Save в настройках: 80px → 100px (текст не обрезается на узких экранах)
- Уменьшены размеры шрифтов на 2px для лучшего отображения на Android (h1: 26, h2: 18, h3: 14, body: 12, bodySmall: 11, caption: 10)

### Fixed
- Исправлена валидация API ключей: при пустом поле показывается ошибка вместо ложного успеха

### Removed
- Удалены персональные данные прогресса из экспорта коллекции: `status`, `current_season`, `current_episode` больше не включаются в `.xcoll`/`.xcollx` файлы. При импорте старых файлов с этими полями — обратная совместимость сохранена
- Удалён класс `CollectionGame` и enum `GameStatus` (`lib/shared/models/collection_game.dart`) — полностью заменены на `CollectionItem` и `ItemStatus`
- Удалён `CollectionGamesNotifier` и провайдеры `collectionGamesProvider`, `collectionGamesNotifierProvider` из `collections_provider.dart` (~180 строк)
- Удалён legacy-маппинг статуса `'playing'` — статус `inProgress` теперь единообразен для всех типов медиа. Миграция БД v13→v14 обновляет существующие записи
- Удалён метод `ItemStatus.dbValue(MediaType)` — везде используется `ItemStatus.value`
- Удалён формат v1 (.rcoll): класс `RcollGame`, константа `xcollLegacyVersion`, методы `_parseV1()`, `createXcollFile()`, `exportToLegacyJson()`, `_importV1()`. Файлы v1 при попытке импорта выбрасывают `FormatException`
- Удалены этапы импорта `ImportStage.cachingGames` и `ImportStage.addingGames` (использовались только v1)
- Удалены геттеры `XcollFile.isV1`, `XcollFile.isV2`, `XcollFile.gameIds`, поле `XcollFile.legacyGames`
- Удалены legacy-методы из `DatabaseService`: `getCollectionGames()`, `getCollectionGamesWithData()`, `getCollectionGameById()`, `addGameToCollection()`, `removeGameFromCollection()`, `updateGameStatus()`, `getCollectionGameCount()`, `getCompletedGameCount()`, `getCollectionStats()`, `clearCollectionGames()` и др.
- Удалены legacy-методы из `CollectionRepository`: `getGames()`, `getGamesWithData()`, `addGame()`, `removeGame()`, `updateGameStatus()` и др.
- Удалено поле `CollectionStats.playing` — заменено на `inProgress`
- Удалён файл `test/shared/models/collection_game_test.dart`

### Changed
- Изменён `GameDetailScreen` — рефакторинг с `CollectionGame`/`collectionGamesNotifierProvider` на `CollectionItem`/`collectionItemsNotifierProvider`, параметр `gameId` → `itemId`
- Изменён `SearchScreen` — `addGame()` заменён на `addItem(mediaType: MediaType.game, ...)` через `collectionItemsNotifierProvider`
- Изменён формат fork snapshot — ключ `'games'` заменён на `'items'` с полями `media_type`/`external_id`/`platform_id`
- Изменена версия БД: 13 → 14
